      <description>Anytime a stock looks headed for a drawdown, a good option technique that can profit from this price movement is the bear call spread. The derivative play receives a net credit at the commencement of the trade, and this profit will be the maximum the strategy earns if the stock sinks below the short call’s strike price. Details of the Bear Call Spread There are two legs in a bear call spread, and as the name implies, each one is a call option.</description>

 What Is a Call Option? What Is a Put Option?What Is a Put Credit Spread? Most people get interested in options trading as a leveraged bet on a stock trade. An options contract controls 100 shares of an underlying stock. If I wanted to purchase 100 shares of the SPY it would cost me around $27,600 (based on today’s price).</description>

      <description>More losses this month for our Put Credit Spreads strategy. Mainly a losing trade that was put on in 2018 and crossed over. I think the markets are calming down and we will start to draw back up. We did have one winning trade which felt good. Take the little wins :).

      <description>Wow! What an unfortunate month for Put Credit Spreads. Afraid this month returned all my yearly gains and then some. A bit of a disappointing way to end the year. We know months like this will happen. Big drawdowns are part of the overall strategy. The key is to take advantage when times are good to build up a stockpile of reserves.

      <description>July has come and gone. We partied for America&#39;s birthday and closed a few profitable trades! Darn good month! July 2018 was another winning month for my SPY Put Credit Spread trading strategy. However, only closing 3 trades for the month is a bit of a sign. Makes me think the market is stalling and might change direction. Low volatility is never a comfortable place to be in. I am starting to prepare for a pull back.</description>

      <description>June 2018 was another winning month for my SPY Put Credit Spread trading strategy. Since IVR has been pretty low closing this many trades was a darn good thing. Just have to be careful to not trade too big. Overall this was a low number of trades for a month -- hence one might want to start increasing trade size. I would not suggest that. A down draw is always just round the corner.</description>

With my Put Credit Spread Trades strategy we have good months, bad months, and &#34;meh&#34; months. It was a nice surprise to have this good month after a losing month. Helps get back our losses.

      <description>Many investors (AKA value investors) like to buy great companies at a bargain. Investors such as Warren Buffett are famous for sitting on a pile of cash and waiting for a great company’s stock price to drop. When the mentioned event happens, value investors tend to jump into thinking they are buying a great company at a discount. This strategy is fine. It works. Heck, we all know Buffett has gotten stupidly rich with this plan of attack.</description>

      <title>Short Strangles Offer Small Rewards And Significant Risks</title>

      <description>A short strangle play is a good opportunity to earn some option premiums if you expect the underlying stock to remain in a narrow trading band until the contracts expire. The maximum gain is limited to just these premiums. If you pay commissions, the greatest profit is even lower. If you guess wrong, and the stock makes a significant move to either the upside or downside, you could experience a substantial loss.</description>

      <description>As you can see from my trades in the table below April 2018 was a losing month. This is a great example of when things go bad -- and they always do. Honestly, this was not even a bad month compared to other bad months. Based on an average net credit of $0.23 it will take 5 winning SPY Put Credit Spread Trades to get back the losses from this month.</description>

      <description>And the fun has started again. I thought this day would never come. Our markets have been so boring for so long -- volatility is back! Sadly I took some losses this month. Losses goes with the strategy it happens from time to time, particularly when the market tanks. The good news is once the decline starts you can pick up some good trades at high opening credits to offset the losses.</description>

      <description>Thanks to the Trump tax cuts the market in January 2018 was pretty stable. Just creeping up in value each day. With volatility so low there were not many opportunities for SPY Put Credit Spread Trades. While I opened a few trades none closed. At the end of January the tax party came to an end and the market got cray cray. Lots to report in my February 2018 update.</description>

      <description>American corporations release their earnings reports every 3 months. The data gives investors an idea of how well the companies are doing financially. If an earnings announcement contains any information traders weren’t expecting, the stock price could plummet or skyrocket, depending on whether the release is negative or positive. On the other hand, if an earnings report is in line with market expectations, the stock price will probably be little affected.</description>

      <description>If your an options volatility trader this is how you felt in the month of October. I was unable to open any put credit spread trades in October. Bottomline......volatility was super low! I think the market is just sort of flat waiting for tax reform. Good news is I have already opened 2 put credit spread trades in November. Hopefully we will return to normal here soon.
Keep in mind this is normal.</description>

      <description>If you expect a stock to remain in a neutral trading range for a few months, maybe because it isn’t set to release earnings or doesn’t have a history of volatility, then you might be able to earn a nice profit while stockholders earn little to nothing. With a unique option strategy, you can sell time, which is why the investment tactic is known as the long calendar spread.
Taking a Long Calendar Spread Position The long calendar option spread can be entered by purchasing one contract and simultaneously selling another contract with a shorter expiration date.</description>

      <description>If a stock is soon to make a major move, either to the upside or downside, a short calendar spread is one method to profit from the price change. The derivative strategy has limited profitability, which is capped at the net credit earned, less commissions. The potential loss in theory is unlimited when using calls and considerable when using puts.
Making a Short Calendar Investment The short calendar spread can be used either with calls or puts, but not a mix of them.</description>

      <title>Introduction to the Butterfly Spread Options Trading Strategy</title>

      <description>Let’s go over the options butterfly spread, a popular advanced trading strategy used by many options traders. It uses four options contracts with the same expiration date. The butterfly allows traders to produce profits off of stable prices, and is generally a low risk but also low profit potential strategy. Let’s dig into why that’s the case, and what it means.
A butterfly spread is a neutral options trading strategy. What does that mean?</description>

      <title>My SPY Put Credit Spread Trades For September 2017</title>

      <description>Once again it is time for our monthly summary of trades I closed. Below are the put credit spread trades I closed in September 2017. My birthday month!!
Compared to August a number of put credit spreads closed this month. Volatility continues to be very low. When volatility is low we have less opportunities to place trades. Low volatility has 2 downsides: it is hard to deploy all your planned capital (not enough trades to place), and the premium you receive from selling the put credit spread is lower than normal (less profit per trade).</description>

      <title>How Does Volatility Affect Option Prices</title>

      <description>Today I’m going to discuss how volatility affects premium. But, first, an explanation of the term is in order. There are two types of volatility that an options trader needs to pay attention. The first is historical volatility. The second is implied volatility.
Historical volatility is just as its name implies. It is a representation of the underlying’s actual past price movement, both up and down. Implied volatility is what the market expects it to be in the future.</description>

      <description>When a stock looks poised for a significant rise or fall, it may be time for a short butterfly play. This option strategy will profit if the underlying stock moves in either direction, so it’s a good choice when you expect a major price movement, but aren’t sure in which direction it will be.
For instance, say a pharmaceutical company is soon to release news about a recent study on the effectiveness of an experimental drug.</description>

      <description>Investing comes with risks, that’s a fact of life. Generally speaking, the greater the risks, the greater the potential for profits. In these regards, options trading offers a high potential for profits, but does come with some higher risks. This is especially true for newer investors. Experienced and/or well-educated options traders, however, can utilize a variety of strategies to lower risks. For newer investors, paper trading options is a great way to get started.</description>

      <description>Today I’m going to walk you through the mechanics of what I look for as I set up a new trade using option greeks. I pay close attention to the Greeks to get a feel for how my trade is going to behave between the time I put it on and the time it expires. Today, I’m looking at a bull call spread on Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. (AAOI). Before we look at the Option Greeks, let me give you the rundown of what I’m looking at on this stock.</description>

      <description>If you expect a stock to trade mostly sideways for the conceivable future, the butterfly option strategy may be worth taking a look at. While it has limited profitability, it also has finite risk. The most you can lose on the trade is the initial cost of entry.
Setting up a Butterfly Spread To create a long butterfly spread position, you trade four option contracts simultaneously. You write two contracts that are at-the-money.</description>

For some of you, this post will be remedial. For others it may be a helpful refresher. And, for sure others, this information may be completely new material. Readers that don’t already have at least some experience with options – either trading them or reading about them – may miss some important points.</description>

      <description>Hello options traders, in a previous article I discussed Delta, and how to use it to make profitable trades. What many traders don’t consider is that your delta doesn’t have to stay consistent throughout a trade. Many professional options traders manage their positions in order to add or decrease delta. Let’s discuss some methods and benefits of managing the delta of positions before they expire.
One downside to utilizing high probability of profit (POP) trades, especially credit spreads, is that they can turn very ugly if the underlying stock moves against you.</description>

      <description>Buy Low Sell High! You’ve heard that old adage about a zillion times because it is the essence of what makes a good trade. But, most novice options traders think of the term as referring only to an option’s premium. Buying premium at a low level and then selling it at a higher level. But, the term is equally applicable – actually more applicable – to buying and selling volatility. In my opinion, that’s where all the opportunity is.</description>

      <description>If you follow my gospel you know I preach trading strategies that remove all emotion. Let’s face it—the stock market is random, and accepting that randomness is the first step to becoming a profitable trader. No one can predict the next tick in the market. I believe you can predict the outcome of many trades in a row, but you can’t predict the outcome of any one trade. Attempting to trade a strategy that requires you to decide whether to enter and exit a trade and the size of the trade, it’s inevitable that your emotions will creep in.</description>

      <description>When a stock appears to be in a range-bound phase, with little expectation that the price will undergo any significant movement, a short straddle may be a wise investment. The maximum profit from this strategy is quite limited; it is just the premiums collected minus commissions. At the same time, the maximum loss is unlimited if the underlying stock goes up. The strategy could also create a significant loss if the stock goes down substantially.</description>

      <description>There are many different types of options. Options are “derivatives”, which simply means that their value is derived from another asset. Consider stock-based options, they derive their value from the stocks that they are based on. In general, derivatives can be based on a huge range of assets. This is true of options as well.
Different Types Of Options Explained While many options are tied to stocks, options can also be based on a huge range of different assets.</description>

Delta is simply one of several values options traders refer to as &#34;greeks&#34;. These numbers are all being used in calculations behind the scenes to determine what the fair premium for an option contract is. Other greeks include Theta and Gamma, but today we will be considering delta and how you can profit from it.</description>

      <description>Iron condor. That might sound like a term that belongs in a World War II documentary, but it’s actually a very effective options trading strategy. With an iron condor, you utilize four different options contracts, or legs, to profit off of relatively stable stock prices. This is a bit different from most investment strategies, which typically rely on asset prices moving up or down. For investors, however, the ability to generate returns off of stable markets, or sideways prices movements as they are often called, adds yet another tool to the investing tool box.</description>

      <description>If you’ve been trading put and call options because you’re bullish or bearish on a particular stock, you’re only capturing part of the market. There will be times when there’s too much uncertainty around a company to know where its stock is headed. Maybe there’s a big news announcement around the corner, or the latest quarterly earnings are soon to be released. But the exact details are unknown. In these types of scenarios, a put or call option isn’t the best course of action, nor is going long or short on the underlying stock.</description>

There is nothing better than picking a direction, applying a leveraged bet via options or futures, and watching that trade take off. I have risked $300 in the morning and closed the day with $2000; that’s a pretty big high.</description>

      <description>When I first started Stockpeer I expected to mostly share my experiences trading the stock market via automation. But I find myself talking less about automation for an important reason: automation can lead to a lack of engagement—aka complacency. No trader has ever gotten rich by being complacent.
I have written thousands of lines of code to backtest and automate different trading strategies. For awhile I was running software that fully automated my consistent put credit spread strategy.</description>

      <description>Recently I have been playing around with something new: trading the futures market as a hedge against my options trading strategy. Why hedge a good bet you ask? Though the strategy I rely on the most—trading put credit spreads on a consistent basis—is pretty reliable, it does occasionally break down, causing a big drawdown in capital. In 2015, for example, I earned profit every month except August and September. The market pulled back hard and fast during those 2 months, and major drawdowns ensued.</description>

      <guid>https://options.cafe/help/does-option-cafe-offer-two-factor-authentication-2fa/</guid>
      <description>Yes. 2FA is an extra layer of security used to make sure that people trying to gain access to an online account are who they say they are. First, a user will enter their username and a password. Then, instead of immediately gaining access, they will be required to provide another piece of information.  We highly recommend setting up two-factor authentication (2FA) with your Options Cafe account.  If you want to secure your Options Cafe account with 2FA, you’ll need to log into Options Cafe using a Google Sign-In.</description>

      <description>To start I want to point out 2 things: this idea is not originally mine, and though I talk mostly about trading I think the concept applies to all forms of investing (buy-and-hold, real estate, fixed income, and so on). From time to time I attend a meetup group called Options for Income in the Portland area, and the tactic I am about to describe comes from Mike, the group leader.</description>

      <description>Want day trading returns without the headache of sitting in front of 26 big-ass monitors all day? You’re in luck because today we are going to discuss trading weekly put credit spreads on the SPY. The idea is pretty basic. I sell a put credit spread on the SPY that expires in 7 days or less. If the SPY does not drop to my short strike price I let the spread expire, keeping the credit.</description>

      <description>I’m baaaaaack! But that’s not to say I am returning empty handed. . . You did notice that I took a nearly 5-month sabbatical from Stockpeer blogging—right? The catalyst was the arrival of my second child, a dangerously sweet little girl who has tipped life into the super busy zone. But a secondary reason for taking a break is that I have been exploring some new types of investment. Though I’m still experimenting, I am ready to share the low-down on what I have been playing with, starting with an overview.</description>

      <description>Anyone who knows me knows that I often offer unsolicited advice in the form of some statement like “You should [fill in the blank].” For example, I pretty much tell anyone I see “You should trade put credit spreads on the SPY!” The truth is, I have no business telling people what they should do—not for the obvious reason that getting up in someone’s grill is not cool, but because investing and trading are personal.</description>

      <description>How much money should you risk with each trade? Trade size is one of the most important considerations of an active trading strategy, and maintaining optimal trade size over time involves technique. In this post we will examine 3 methods for determining trade size and how they fared when they were backtested against my consistent put credit spread strategy on the SPY. In each backtest I started with a balance of $50,000 and tested from 2010 through 2014.</description>

      <description>Many people think day trading is gambling: you might win for awhile, but eventually you will blow up your account. I agree—yet I day trade the SPY almost every day. Day trading is part of my overflow method and multiple strategy approach to managing my portfolio. I day trade very little capital, and I direct the profits into my less risky accounts.
So why bother if day trading is gambling? Simply put, I can increase my odds of a successful return using money management techniques.</description>

      <description>If you&#39;re anything like me you already have a consistent trading strategy figured out. You’re just placing the same trades repeatedly, trying to rack up as many occurrences throughout the year as you can. But the more you trade, the more commissions impact your performance—which is why eOption.com is one of my favorite brokers for trading credit spreads.
That’s because eOption.com is all about price—no frills, just trading at a very low cost.</description>

      <description>I treat my trading and investing as a business, and like any prudent business manager I am constantly seeking to trim costs while growing revenue. With options trading the biggest costs are the commissions your broker charges for every trade. So in the interest of taming those fees I built a tool to help you find the cheapest broker for particular options trading strategies: say hello to Broker Finder.
  I routinely review and compare the broker commissions I pay, and I have realized that no one broker is the cheapest for every transaction.</description>

      <description>When I got interested in trading credit spreads, like most I harbored some skepticism. A credit spread trade seemed to be the type that works—until rather dramatically it does not. More than once I put on a series of successful trades and then Dr. Jeckyll transformed into his evil alter ego Mr. Hyde and suddenly I was blowing up my account. Clearly, I did not know what I was doing. On the verge of giving up, I convinced myself that I was just missing something.</description>

      <description>When I talk to people about my credit spread trading strategy I often hear the claim that credit spread trading works great for 5, 10, or 20 thousand dollars, but the strategy can’t be scaled up. Are these skeptics suggesting a lack of liquidity to fill bigger orders? Or that trades in the 100 thousand range have the power to move markets? Bunkum. When trading an underlying such as the SPY or SPX there is plenty of liquidity.</description>

      <title>Should I Consider Delta When Opening SPY Put Credit Spreads?</title>

      <description>Delta is a metric that options traders use to predict how the price of an option will change when the underlying stock moves by one dollar. If, for example, a call option has a delta of .3 and the underlying stock value increases from $100 to $101, then theoretically that call option would increase in value by $0.30.
Delta is also a probability proxy. You can think of delta as the probability the option will expire in the money—so in other words that call option with a delta of .</description>

      <description>Almost all of my credit spread trading is focused on the S&amp;amp;P 500 via the SPY or S&amp;amp;P 500 futures. Why am I hyperfocused on the SPY? So I can sleep at night (well, try to sleep—I do have a young son and a daughter on the way). The S&amp;amp;P 500 is such a big index that it generally doesn’t move dramatically. In contrast, Netflix recently posted a 31% change in a single week, which is just too much for me to handle.</description>

      <description>Every great trader has a bag of tricks. Each of these opportunities, if you will, is a predefined market condition signaling when to enter a trade and when to close it. One that has been in my bag for awhile is buying the SPY when the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator hits 30. My MO is to keep a tight stop and refrain from getting too greedy. Which means what, exactly?</description>

      <description>Like most traders I got started as a stock picker following the most basic of rules: do your homework and have a diversified portfolio. This credo is sound, and it’s the approach I use for some of my accounts. The key to this more traditional approach is understanding that your emotions do play a factor in your investing decisions—and that learning how to manage your emotions can be the pivot between success and failure.</description>

      <description>“If you&#39;re ignoring volatility, you may only have yourself to blame for negative surprises.” ~ John Summa - http://investopedia.com
The day I learned to pay attention to volatility was the day I started to be consistently profitable in options trading. Most options traders start out trading stocks and they learn that if a stock is associated with good news its value often increases, whereas bad news sends a stock down. It’s that simple.</description>

      <title>How Often the SPY Falls More Than 5% in a 30-Day Period and Why You Should Care</title>

      <description>During any 30-day period from 1993 through 2014 the SPY (the Exchange Traded Funds, or ETFs, tracking the S&amp;amp;P 500) closed down 5% or more 11% of the time. I know this obscure fact because for every one of the 5,502 trading days during that period I compared the SPY closing price with the closing price 30 trading days later. (My results can be found here.)
And that’s not all: Further examination of 30-day periods that closed down more than 5% within shorter time frames (say 3 years) revealed rates as high as 20% during extreme bear markets (hello real estate meltdown) and as low as 3% during bull markets.</description>

      <description>By my best calculations, going back to my piggy bank years, my personal spending has increased by 10% annually—and my assumption is that I will continue shelling out at this rate well into the future. Sure, I am a spender, but when you really think about it 10% is not crazy. Both hidden costs such as rising property taxes and obvious money pits such as kids factor into my 10%. Though I have only been tracking my spending in recent years, I suspect that subconsciously I have been aware of my rate because I have always managed my career and investments to accommodate it.</description>

      <description>Anyone who manages their own money should use a multiple strategy approach—a form of diversification, if you will. I personally maintain 4 strategies: buying &amp;amp; holding stocks, investing in real estate, index option credit spread trading, and directional option trading. I find these to be great options for diversification.
I typically hold stocks (and some bitcoin) for 18 months or more and enjoy dividend returns. I sell a stock when the upside story changes, though I have owned some stocks for years.</description>

      <description>I love this time of year: vacation, family, drinks, parties, gifts, Santa, and the rest are all great. Almost equally I love this time of year because I am reminded to take time to reflect on the past year, which gives me an opportunity to map a game plan for the coming year. I feel like I am coming up for air and can look at the big picture once again.</description>

      <title>What Is So Special About Option Credit Spreads?</title>

      <description>When considering an investment opportunity you examine 3 factors: potential return, risk of losing money, and effort required to maintain the investment. For example, when buying a stock you put a fair amount of effort into finding the best company to buy into, and you check up on the company every quarter to ensure that your strategy remains sound. Before buying, you estimate your overall return based on your assumptions, and you prudently consider how much you might lose if the trade goes against you.</description>

      <title>What Is a Put Credit Spread?</title>

      <guid>https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread/</guid>
      <description>In the options trading world there is a type of trade called a put credit spread. The goal of this trade is to collect money and hope the market does not move against you. Let me explain with an analogy we all understand: car insurance. Every month you cough up a hundred bucks or so for coverage, and your insurance company makes a calculated bet that you will not get in a car accident.</description>

      <description>A put option is the opposite of a call option—and if you don’t know what that is, see my previous post What Is a Call Option? This post uses a fictional scenario to illustrate the basics of what a put option is. I do not get super detailed here, but links to more in-depth resources can be found at the end of the post.
Lets Get Started I have a nice Apple laptop with all the bells and whistles that I paid up for in part because Apple products are known to have good resale value.</description>

      <description>Let’s imagine that I have a tractor I am offering for sale for $20,000—which is a smoking deal because the same tractor is selling elsewhere for $25,000. My neighbor realizes that I am unaware of the fair market price and concludes that my tractor would be a good investment for him. What’s more, he has come into an inheritance—but he has to wait 6 months to get the money while the courts probate the will.</description>

      <title>Step 1: Pick a Smart Trading Strategy</title>

      <description>The difference between success, failure, and mediocrity on Wall Street is your ability to pick a smart trading or investing strategy and stick to it. Jumping into the market without first carefully defining your strategy is akin to driving a car with a blindfold on—and, likewise, you will crash at some point. Just as critical is remaining faithful to your strategy during drawdowns—because you will reap the benefits of constancy in the long run.</description>

      <description>Wall Street is the domain of traders and investors. Typically we envision traders sitting in front of rows of monitors looking to make a quick buck by continually getting into and out of financial positions. In contrast, investors are the Warren Buffett types who buy and hold stocks for long periods of time. Traditionally, you are one or the other because traders and investors often disagree, maintaining that the strategy of the other is a recipe for underperformance.</description>

      <title>The Only Free Lunch in Trading Is a Consistent Trading Strategy</title>
      <link>https://options.cafe/blog/the-only-free-lunch-in-trading-is-a-consistent-trading-strategy/</link>

      <guid>https://options.cafe/blog/the-only-free-lunch-in-trading-is-a-consistent-trading-strategy/</guid>
      <description>What I mean by a consistent trading strategy is if you build a smart trading strategy and stick to it you are almost certain to make money. I make this claim with such conviction because I assume that you backtest your strategy. That you factor in maximum drawdown periods (times when you lose money). And most critical, that you understand the importance of fidelity to your strategy—because inconsistent strategy is the road to a blown-out account.</description>

      <description>Below you will find all of the trades I closed out in October 2014. I plan to post a summary of my complete (not cherry picked) credit spread portfolio each month, and in the future I will share trades as I make them. Why am I doing this? Because bragging about my winning trades strokes my ego, of course. :)  Though that last statement might be partly true, I am really divulging my trades for more worthy reasons.</description>
