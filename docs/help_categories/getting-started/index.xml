      <title>Does Option Cafe offer two-factor authentication (2FA)?</title>

      <description>Yes. 2FA is an extra layer of security used to make sure that people trying to gain access to an online account are who they say they are. First, a user will enter their username and a password. Then, instead of immediately gaining access, they will be required to provide another piece of information. We highly recommend setting up two-factor authentication (2FA) with your Options Cafe account. If you want to secure your Options Cafe account with 2FA, youâ€™ll need to log into Options Cafe using a Google Sign-In.</description>
