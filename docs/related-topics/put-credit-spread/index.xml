      <description>April showers bring epic put credit spread trades! Another good month of trading!
Our Put Credit Spreads strategy is looking good! We are officially back to even from our January drawdown. This has been a good lesson in how drawdowns work.

      <description>March had some good trades!! A very winning month. The best part about the month, for me at least, is Oregon had some epic snow. I had some amazing turns in! I digress.....back to options.
Our Put Credit Spreads strategy is looking good! If April is a good month we should be back to even from our January drawdown.

      <description>February......The month of love.....(at least here in the US)......The market gave us tons of love!!
Finally, some winning trades this month for our Put Credit Spreads strategy. These wins really helped build back up our drawdown from past months.

      <description>More losses this month for our Put Credit Spreads strategy. Mainly a losing trade that was put on in 2018 and crossed over. I think the markets are calming down and we will start to draw back up. We did have one winning trade which felt good. Take the little wins :).

      <description>Wow! What an unfortunate month for Put Credit Spreads. Afraid this month returned all my yearly gains and then some. A bit of a disappointing way to end the year. We know months like this will happen. Big drawdowns are part of the overall strategy. The key is to take advantage when times are good to build up a stockpile of reserves.

      <description>Well, finally an engaging month for Put Credit Spreads. Afraid the engagement was in the wrong direction. In November we took some losses. Not a big deal since we have had so many winning past months. However, losses are never fun.

      <description>With October 2018 completed we move on to November. Again this was a little bit of a boring month as we only closed one trade. We do have some trades on the board that will close in November. My fingers are crossed for more excitement.

      <description>With August 2018 in the bag we look forward to September. Traders leave their Hamptons pads and get back to work. My SPY Put Credit Spread trading strategy only closed one trade this month. Hoping for a creep up in IVR next month.

      <description>July has come and gone. We partied for America&#39;s birthday and closed a few profitable trades! Darn good month! July 2018 was another winning month for my SPY Put Credit Spread trading strategy. However, only closing 3 trades for the month is a bit of a sign. Makes me think the market is stalling and might change direction. Low volatility is never a comfortable place to be in. I am starting to prepare for a pull back.</description>

      <description>June 2018 was another winning month for my SPY Put Credit Spread trading strategy. Since IVR has been pretty low closing this many trades was a darn good thing. Just have to be careful to not trade too big. Overall this was a low number of trades for a month -- hence one might want to start increasing trade size. I would not suggest that. A down draw is always just round the corner.</description>

      <description>As you can see from my trades in the table below May 2018 was a winning month. This is a great example of good times with this strategy. With my Put Credit Spread Trades strategy we have good months, bad months, and &#34;meh&#34; months. It was a nice surprise to have this good month after a losing month. Helps get back our losses.

      <description>As you can see from my trades in the table below April 2018 was a losing month. This is a great example of when things go bad -- and they always do. Honestly, this was not even a bad month compared to other bad months. Based on an average net credit of $0.23 it will take 5 winning SPY Put Credit Spread Trades to get back the losses from this month.</description>

      <title>Learning The Short Butterfly Strategy</title>

      <description>When a stock looks poised for a significant rise or fall, it may be time for a short butterfly play. This option strategy will profit if the underlying stock moves in either direction, so itâ€™s a good choice when you expect a major price movement, but arenâ€™t sure in which direction it will be.
For instance, say a pharmaceutical company is soon to release news about a recent study on the effectiveness of an experimental drug.</description>

      <description>If your a follower of this blog or a follower of my trades you might have noticed I stopped posting trades. That is all about to change starting with this post. I am once again committed to posting the trades I place monthly. The reason for the absence in trade posting is we have been crazy busy preparing for the launch of our new trading platform -- Just not enough hours in the day :(.</description>

      <description>Buy Low Sell High! Youâ€™ve heard that old adage about a zillion times because it is the essence of what makes a good trade. But, most novice options traders think of the term as referring only to an optionâ€™s premium. Buying premium at a low level and then selling it at a higher level. But, the term is equally applicable â€“ actually more applicable â€“ to buying and selling volatility. In my opinion, thatâ€™s where all the opportunity is.</description>

      <description>When I got interested in trading credit spreads, like most I harbored some skepticism. A credit spread trade seemed to be the type that worksâ€”until rather dramatically it does not. More than once I put on a series of successful trades and then Dr. Jeckyll transformed into his evil alter ego Mr. Hyde and suddenly I was blowing up my account. Clearly, I did not know what I was doing. On the verge of giving up, I convinced myself that I was just missing something.</description>

      <guid>https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread/</guid>
      <description>In the options trading world there is a type of trade called a put credit spread. The goal of this trade is to collect money and hope the market does not move against you. Let me explain with an analogy we all understand: car insurance. Every month you cough up a hundred bucks or so for coverage, and your insurance company makes a calculated bet that you will not get in a car accident.</description>
