      <description>Let’s go over the options butterfly spread, a popular advanced trading strategy used by many options traders. It uses four options contracts with the same expiration date. The butterfly allows traders to produce profits off of stable prices, and is generally a low risk but also low profit potential strategy. Let’s dig into why that’s the case, and what it means.
A butterfly spread is a neutral options trading strategy. What does that mean?</description>

      <description>Once again it is time for our monthly summary of trades I closed. Below are the put credit spread trades I closed in September 2017. My birthday month!!
Compared to August a number of put credit spreads closed this month. Volatility continues to be very low. When volatility is low we have less opportunities to place trades. Low volatility has 2 downsides: it is hard to deploy all your planned capital (not enough trades to place), and the premium you receive from selling the put credit spread is lower than normal (less profit per trade).</description>

      <description>Why do you invest? Why do you trade? Why do you spend your nights and weekend studying how to make a few bucks in the market? Because you want to make money! By applying some time, money, and knowledge you can be better off financially, right? Heck, who doesn’t want that? Maybe not my friend Eddie—I think he’s a monk or something :).
Maybe I can become the next Warren Buffett Ok, you’ve got the time.</description>

      <description>If your a follower of this blog or a follower of my trades you might have noticed I stopped posting trades. That is all about to change starting with this post. I am once again committed to posting the trades I place monthly. The reason for the absence in trade posting is we have been crazy busy preparing for the launch of our new trading platform -- Just not enough hours in the day :(.</description>
