      <description>March had some good trades!! A very winning month. The best part about the month, for me at least, is Oregon had some epic snow. I had some amazing turns in! I digress.....back to options.
Our Put Credit Spreads strategy is looking good! If April is a good month we should be back to even from our January drawdown.

      <description>Wow! What an unfortunate month for Put Credit Spreads. Afraid this month returned all my yearly gains and then some. A bit of a disappointing way to end the year. We know months like this will happen. Big drawdowns are part of the overall strategy. The key is to take advantage when times are good to build up a stockpile of reserves.

      <description>With October 2018 completed we move on to November. Again this was a little bit of a boring month as we only closed one trade. We do have some trades on the board that will close in November. My fingers are crossed for more excitement.

      <description>With August 2018 in the bag we look forward to September. Traders leave their Hamptons pads and get back to work. My SPY Put Credit Spread trading strategy only closed one trade this month. Hoping for a creep up in IVR next month.

      <description>July has come and gone. We partied for America&#39;s birthday and closed a few profitable trades! Darn good month! July 2018 was another winning month for my SPY Put Credit Spread trading strategy. However, only closing 3 trades for the month is a bit of a sign. Makes me think the market is stalling and might change direction. Low volatility is never a comfortable place to be in. I am starting to prepare for a pull back.</description>

      <description>June 2018 was another winning month for my SPY Put Credit Spread trading strategy. Since IVR has been pretty low closing this many trades was a darn good thing. Just have to be careful to not trade too big. Overall this was a low number of trades for a month -- hence one might want to start increasing trade size. I would not suggest that. A down draw is always just round the corner.</description>

      <description>As you can see from my trades in the table below May 2018 was a winning month. This is a great example of good times with this strategy. With my Put Credit Spread Trades strategy we have good months, bad months, and &#34;meh&#34; months. It was a nice surprise to have this good month after a losing month. Helps get back our losses.

      <description>As you can see from my trades in the table below April 2018 was a losing month. This is a great example of when things go bad -- and they always do. Honestly, this was not even a bad month compared to other bad months. Based on an average net credit of $0.23 it will take 5 winning SPY Put Credit Spread Trades to get back the losses from this month.</description>

      <description>And the fun has started again. I thought this day would never come. Our markets have been so boring for so long -- volatility is back! Sadly I took some losses this month. Losses goes with the strategy it happens from time to time, particularly when the market tanks. The good news is once the decline starts you can pick up some good trades at high opening credits to offset the losses.</description>

      <description>Thanks to the Trump tax cuts the market in January 2018 was pretty stable. Just creeping up in value each day. With volatility so low there were not many opportunities for SPY Put Credit Spread Trades. While I opened a few trades none closed. At the end of January the tax party came to an end and the market got cray cray. Lots to report in my February 2018 update. </description>

      <description>If you are an options volatility trader November was a boring month. I opened 2 put credit spread trades in November -- none closed. We will look at these closing trades in December.
We are in sit and wait mode. Just like this dog......
Keep in mind this is normal. Many volatility based options traders with a consistent strategy often have dry months.</description>

      <description>If your an options volatility trader this is how you felt in the month of October. I was unable to open any put credit spread trades in October. Bottomline......volatility was super low! I think the market is just sort of flat waiting for tax reform. Good news is I have already opened 2 put credit spread trades in November. Hopefully we will return to normal here soon.
Keep in mind this is normal.</description>

      <description>Once again it is time for our monthly summary of trades I closed. Below are the put credit spread trades I closed in September 2017. My birthday month!!
Compared to August a number of put credit spreads closed this month. Volatility continues to be very low. When volatility is low we have less opportunities to place trades. Low volatility has 2 downsides: it is hard to deploy all your planned capital (not enough trades to place), and the premium you receive from selling the put credit spread is lower than normal (less profit per trade).</description>

      <description>If your a follower of this blog or a follower of my trades you might have noticed I stopped posting trades. That is all about to change starting with this post. I am once again committed to posting the trades I place monthly. The reason for the absence in trade posting is we have been crazy busy preparing for the launch of our new trading platform -- Just not enough hours in the day :(.</description>

      <description>Many people think day trading is gambling: you might win for awhile, but eventually you will blow up your account. I agree—yet I day trade the SPY almost every day. Day trading is part of my overflow method and multiple strategy approach to managing my portfolio. I day trade very little capital, and I direct the profits into my less risky accounts.
So why bother if day trading is gambling? Simply put, I can increase my odds of a successful return using money management techniques.</description>

      <description>Below you will find all of the trades I closed out in October 2014. I plan to post a summary of my complete (not cherry picked) credit spread portfolio each month, and in the future I will share trades as I make them. Why am I doing this? Because bragging about my winning trades strokes my ego, of course. :) Though that last statement might be partly true, I am really divulging my trades for more worthy reasons.</description>
