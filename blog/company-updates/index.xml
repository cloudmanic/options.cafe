Current customers, don't worry nothing is changing for you. Let's Start with Some Background I wrote the first code for what became the Options Cafe trading platform back in 2004. As a trained software developer writing programs is always the first place I start when trying to solve a problem, this is how our trading platform started.</description></item><item><title>Options Cafe Has Launched</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/options-cafe-has-launched/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jan 2019 20:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/options-cafe-has-launched/</guid><description>I have some big news!! Today, we are officially announcing the launch of Options Cafe. You can now use our platform to make options trades via Tradier. No other trading platform allows you to discover, trade, and review your trades like Options Cafe. We have built Options Cafe from the ground up with one thing in mind — making multi-leg options trading a snap. I think we have built the options platform you have been yearning for.</description></item><item><title>Tradier and the On-Going Options Trading Software Revolution</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/tradier-and-the-on-going-options-trading-software-revolution/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Nov 2017 03:44:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/tradier-and-the-on-going-options-trading-software-revolution/</guid><description>Have you heard of the brokerage API "Tradier"? It’s a powerful software/toolset that is literally reshaping the investment brokerage field. Tradier is making it possible for option traders to use powerful, specialized option software, such as Options Cafe, and to integrate it directly into trading. Beyond options, Tradier is revolutionizing trading with other assets, such as stocks.
Here’s how the old way worked: You picked a broker, you used that broker, and you used their tools.</description></item><item><title>Stockpeer.com Blog Becomes Options Cafe Software: New Name, New Vision</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/stockpeer-com-blog-becomes-options-cafe-software-new-name-new-vision/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2017 04:11:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/stockpeer-com-blog-becomes-options-cafe-software-new-name-new-vision/</guid><description>Say hello to Options Cafe! As the Founder and CEO of Stockpeer, and a tenured software developer, I am excited to announce that the Stockpeer.com blog is retiring and Options.Cafe is taking over. When I registered Stockpeer.com nearly 10 years ago, I had a much different vision. While I was trading options, at the time, stocks were my passion. Fast forward to today, and options have become the bulk of my trading activity.</description></item><item><title>Backtesting Options Is Here</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/backtesting-options-is-here/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Nov 2016 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/backtesting-options-is-here/</guid><description>Have you ever wondered how your options trading strategy would perform over time? I have, so I built a backtester. I wanted a way to simulate trading the options market day to day to see how well my strategies would have fared. Until now I have kept this backtester to myself, but today I am happy to introduce the Stockpeer backtester to the world. You can play with it by visiting https://stockpeer.</description></item><item><title>Broker Finder—Find the Cheapest Broker for Options Trading</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/broker-finder-find-the-cheapest-broker-for-options-trading/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2015 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/broker-finder-find-the-cheapest-broker-for-options-trading/</guid><description>I treat my trading and investing as a business, and like any prudent business manager I am constantly seeking to trim costs while growing revenue. With options trading the biggest costs are the commissions your broker charges for every trade. So in the interest of taming those fees I built a tool to help you find the cheapest broker for particular options trading strategies: say hello to Broker Finder.
I routinely review and compare the broker commissions I pay, and I have realized that no one broker is the cheapest for every transaction.</description></item></channel></rss>
