Investors such as Warren Buffett are famous for sitting on a pile of cash and waiting for a great company’s stock price to drop. When the mentioned event happens, value investors tend to jump into thinking they are buying a great company at a discount.</description></item><item><title>How Successful Options Traders Generate Monthly Income</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/how-successful-options-traders-generate-monthly-income/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Sep 2017 21:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/how-successful-options-traders-generate-monthly-income/</guid><description>Why do you invest? Why do you trade? Why do you spend your nights and weekend studying how to make a few bucks in the market? Because you want to make money! By applying some time, money, and knowledge you can be better off financially, right? Heck, who doesn’t want that?</description></item><item><title>How I Prevent Emotional Trading</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/how-i-prevent-emotional-trading/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Aug 2017 16:23:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/how-i-prevent-emotional-trading/</guid><description>If you follow my gospel you know I preach trading strategies that remove all emotion. Let’s face it—the stock market is random, and accepting that randomness is the first step to becoming a profitable trader. No one can predict the next tick in the market. I believe you can predict the outcome of many trades in a row, but you can’t predict the outcome of any one trade.</description></item><item><title>Directional Options Trading Is Not for Me (Typically)</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/directional-options-trading-is-not-for-me-typically/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jul 2017 19:03:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/directional-options-trading-is-not-for-me-typically/</guid><description>I like directional trading—heck, I even blog about it from time to time—but for the most part directional options trading is a hobby, something I do for fun with my FU money. There is nothing better than picking a direction, applying a leveraged bet via options or futures, and watching that trade take off.</description></item><item><title>Staying Engaged in the Market Is Key</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/staying-engaged-in-the-market-is-key/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Oct 2016 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/staying-engaged-in-the-market-is-key/</guid><description>When I first started Stockpeer I expected to mostly share my experiences trading the stock market via automation. But I find myself talking less about automation for an important reason: automation can lead to a lack of engagement—aka complacency. No trader has ever gotten rich by being complacent.
I have written thousands of lines of code to backtest and automate different trading strategies.</description></item><item><title>Trading Futures as a Hedge</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/trading-futures-as-a-hedge/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Oct 2016 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/trading-futures-as-a-hedge/</guid><description>Recently I have been playing around with something new: trading the futures market as a hedge against my options trading strategy. Why hedge a good bet you ask? Though the strategy I rely on the most—trading put credit spreads on a consistent basis—is pretty reliable, it does occasionally break down, causing a big drawdown in capital.</description></item><item><title>The Importance of Grading Your Trades</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/the-importance-of-grading-your-trades/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Mar 2016 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/the-importance-of-grading-your-trades/</guid><description>To start I want to point out 2 things: this idea is not originally mine, and though I talk mostly about trading I think the concept applies to all forms of investing (buy-and-hold, real estate, fixed income, and so on). From time to time I attend a meetup group called Options for Income in the Portland area, and the tactic I am about to describe comes from Mike, the group leader.</description></item><item><title>Trading Weekly Put Credit Spreads</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/trading-weekly-put-credit-spreads/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jan 2016 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/trading-weekly-put-credit-spreads/</guid><description>Want day trading returns without the headache of sitting in front of 26 big-ass monitors all day? You’re in luck because today we are going to discuss trading weekly put credit spreads on the SPY. The idea is pretty basic. I sell a put credit spread on the SPY that expires in 7 days or less.</description></item><item><title>I Took a Blogging Sabbatical and Didn’t Even Get You a Lousy T-Shirt</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/i-took-a-blogging-sabbatical-and-didnt-even-get-you-a-lousy-t-shirt/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Oct 2015 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/i-took-a-blogging-sabbatical-and-didnt-even-get-you-a-lousy-t-shirt/</guid><description>I’m baaaaaack! But that’s not to say I am returning empty handed. . . You did notice that I took a nearly 5-month sabbatical from Stockpeer blogging—right? The catalyst was the arrival of my second child, a dangerously sweet little girl who has tipped life into the super busy zone. But a secondary reason for taking a break is that I have been exploring some new types of investment.</description></item><item><title>Picking an Investment Style That Suits You</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/picking-an-investment-style-that-suits-you/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Apr 2015 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/picking-an-investment-style-that-suits-you/</guid><description>Anyone who knows me knows that I often offer unsolicited advice in the form of some statement like “You should [fill in the blank].” For example, I pretty much tell anyone I see “You should trade put credit spreads on the SPY!” The truth is, I have no business telling people what they should do—not for the obvious reason that getting up in someone’s grill is not cool, but because investing and trading are personal.</description></item><item><title>What Size Trades Should You Put on When Trading SPY Put Credit Spreads?</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/what-size-trades-should-you-put-on-when-trading-spy-put-credit-spreads/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Mar 2015 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/what-size-trades-should-you-put-on-when-trading-spy-put-credit-spreads/</guid><description>How much money should you risk with each trade? Trade size is one of the most important considerations of an active trading strategy, and maintaining optimal trade size over time involves technique. In this post we will examine 3 methods for determining trade size and how they fared when they were backtested against my consistent put credit spread strategy on the SPY.</description></item><item><title>eOption.com - Hands Down The Cheapest Trading Commissions</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/eoption-com-hands-down-the-cheapest-trading-commissions/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Mar 2015 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/eoption-com-hands-down-the-cheapest-trading-commissions/</guid><description>If you're anything like me you already have a consistent trading strategy figured out. You’re just placing the same trades repeatedly, trying to rack up as many occurrences throughout the year as you can. But the more you trade, the more commissions impact your performance—which is why eOption.com is one of my favorite brokers for trading credit spreads.</description></item><item><title>Baseline Strategy for Trading SPY Put Credit Spreads</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/baseline-strategy-for-trading-spy-put-credit-spreads/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2015 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/baseline-strategy-for-trading-spy-put-credit-spreads/</guid><description>When I got interested in trading credit spreads, like most I harbored some skepticism. A credit spread trade seemed to be the type that works—until rather dramatically it does not. More than once I put on a series of successful trades and then Dr. Jeckyll transformed into his evil alter ego Mr.</description></item><item><title>Scaling Your Investments via Overflow</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/scaling-your-investments-via-overflow/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2015 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/scaling-your-investments-via-overflow/</guid><description>When I talk to people about my credit spread trading strategy I often hear the claim that credit spread trading works great for 5, 10, or 20 thousand dollars, but the strategy can’t be scaled up. Are these skeptics suggesting a lack of liquidity to fill bigger orders? Or that trades in the 100 thousand range have the power to move markets?</description></item><item><title>Should I Consider Delta When Opening SPY Put Credit Spreads?</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/should-i-consider-delta-when-opening-spy-put-credit-spreads/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2015 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/should-i-consider-delta-when-opening-spy-put-credit-spreads/</guid><description>Delta is a metric that options traders use to predict how the price of an option will change when the underlying stock moves by one dollar. If, for example, a call option has a delta of .3 and the underlying stock value increases from $100 to $101, then theoretically that call option would increase in value by $0.</description></item><item><title>Being Hyperfocused on the SPY</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/being-hyperfocused-on-the-spy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2015 19:57:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/being-hyperfocused-on-the-spy/</guid><description>Almost all of my credit spread trading is focused on the S&amp;amp;P 500 via the SPY or S&amp;amp;P 500 futures. Why am I hyperfocused on the SPY? So I can sleep at night (well, try to sleep—I do have a young son and a daughter on the way). The S&amp;amp;P 500 is such a big index that it generally doesn’t move dramatically.</description></item><item><title>How to Use the RSI Indicator to Trade the SPY</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/how-to-use-the-rsi-indicator-to-trade-the-spy/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2015 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/how-to-use-the-rsi-indicator-to-trade-the-spy/</guid><description>Every great trader has a bag of tricks. Each of these opportunities, if you will, is a predefined market condition signaling when to enter a trade and when to close it. One that has been in my bag for awhile is buying the SPY when the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator hits 30.</description></item><item><title>Mechanical vs. Emotional Trading</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/mechanical-vs-emotional-trading/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2015 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/mechanical-vs-emotional-trading/</guid><description>Like most traders I got started as a stock picker following the most basic of rules: do your homework and have a diversified portfolio. This credo is sound, and it’s the approach I use for some of my accounts. The key to this more traditional approach is understanding that your emotions do play a factor in your investing decisions—and that learning how to manage your emotions can be the pivot between success and failure.</description></item><item><title>Making Volatility Your Bitch</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/making-volatility-your-bitch/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2015 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/making-volatility-your-bitch/</guid><description>“If you're ignoring volatility, you may only have yourself to blame for negative surprises.” ~ John Summa - http://investopedia.com
The day I learned to pay attention to volatility was the day I started to be consistently profitable in options trading. Most options traders start out trading stocks and they learn that if a stock is associated with good news its value often increases, whereas bad news sends a stock down.</description></item><item><title>How Often the SPY Falls More Than 5% in a 30-Day Period and Why You Should Care</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/how-often-the-spy-falls-more-than-5-in-a-30-day-period-and-why-you-should-care/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2015 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/how-often-the-spy-falls-more-than-5-in-a-30-day-period-and-why-you-should-care/</guid><description>During any 30-day period from 1993 through 2014 the SPY (the Exchange Traded Funds, or ETFs, tracking the S&amp;amp;P 500) closed down 5% or more 11% of the time. I know this obscure fact because for every one of the 5,502 trading days during that period I compared the SPY closing price with the closing price 30 trading days later.</description></item><item><title>How Much Do You Spend Each Year?</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/how-much-do-you-spend-each-year/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2015 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/how-much-do-you-spend-each-year/</guid><description>By my best calculations, going back to my piggy bank years, my personal spending has increased by 10% annually—and my assumption is that I will continue shelling out at this rate well into the future. Sure, I am a spender, but when you really think about it 10% is not crazy.</description></item><item><title>Options For Diversification : The Importance of a Multiple Strategy Approach</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/options-for-diversification-the-importance-of-a-multiple-strategy-approach/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2015 19:20:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/options-for-diversification-the-importance-of-a-multiple-strategy-approach/</guid><description>Anyone who manages their own money should use a multiple strategy approach—a form of diversification, if you will. I personally maintain 4 strategies: buying &amp;amp; holding stocks, investing in real estate, index option credit spread trading, and directional option trading. I find these to be great options for diversification.
I typically hold stocks (and some bitcoin) for 18 months or more and enjoy dividend returns.</description></item><item><title>Step 1: Pick a Smart Trading Strategy</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/step-1-pick-a-smart-trading-strategy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Dec 2014 02:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/step-1-pick-a-smart-trading-strategy/</guid><description>The difference between success, failure, and mediocrity on Wall Street is your ability to pick a smart trading or investing strategy and stick to it. Jumping into the market without first carefully defining your strategy is akin to driving a car with a blindfold on—and, likewise, you will crash at some point.</description></item><item><title>The Only Free Lunch in Trading Is a Consistent Trading Strategy</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/the-only-free-lunch-in-trading-is-a-consistent-trading-strategy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2014 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/the-only-free-lunch-in-trading-is-a-consistent-trading-strategy/</guid><description>What I mean by a consistent trading strategy is if you build a smart trading strategy and stick to it you are almost certain to make money. I make this claim with such conviction because I assume that you backtest your strategy. That you factor in maximum drawdown periods (times when you lose money).</description></item><item><title>Hello Interwebs</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/hello-interwebs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2014 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/hello-interwebs/</guid><description>Welcome to the inaugural blog post of Stockpeer.com.
