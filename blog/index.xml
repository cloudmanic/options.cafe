The maximum gain is limited to just these premiums. If you pay commissions, the greatest profit is even lower.

I have, so I built a backtester. I wanted a way to simulate trading the options market day to day to see how well my strategies would have fared. Until now I have kept this backtester to myself, but today I am happy to introduce the Stockpeer backtester to the world.</description></item><item><title>Staying Engaged in the Market Is Key</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/staying-engaged-in-the-market-is-key/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Oct 2016 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/staying-engaged-in-the-market-is-key/</guid><description>When I first started Stockpeer I expected to mostly share my experiences trading the stock market via automation. But I find myself talking less about automation for an important reason: automation can lead to a lack of engagement—aka complacency. No trader has ever gotten rich by being complacent.
I have written thousands of lines of code to backtest and automate different trading strategies.</description></item><item><title>Trading Futures as a Hedge</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/trading-futures-as-a-hedge/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Oct 2016 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/trading-futures-as-a-hedge/</guid><description>Recently I have been playing around with something new: trading the futures market as a hedge against my options trading strategy. Why hedge a good bet you ask? Though the strategy I rely on the most—trading put credit spreads on a consistent basis—is pretty reliable, it does occasionally break down, causing a big drawdown in capital.</description></item><item><title>The Importance of Grading Your Trades</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/the-importance-of-grading-your-trades/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Mar 2016 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/the-importance-of-grading-your-trades/</guid><description>To start I want to point out 2 things: this idea is not originally mine, and though I talk mostly about trading I think the concept applies to all forms of investing (buy-and-hold, real estate, fixed income, and so on).

Why am I hyperfocused on the SPY? So I can sleep at night (well, try to sleep—I do have a young son and a daughter on the way).

This credo is sound, and it’s the approach I use for some of my accounts. The key to this more traditional approach is understanding that your emotions do play a factor in your investing decisions—and that learning how to manage your emotions can be the pivot between success and failure.</description></item><item><title>Making Volatility Your Bitch</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/making-volatility-your-bitch/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2015 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/making-volatility-your-bitch/</guid><description>“If you're ignoring volatility, you may only have yourself to blame for negative surprises.” ~ John Summa - http://investopedia.com

The goal of this trade is to collect money and hope the market does not move against you. Let me explain with an analogy we all understand: car insurance.
