Mainly a losing trade that was put on in 2018 and crossed over. I &lt;strong>think&lt;/strong> the markets are calming down and we will start to draw back up.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Options Cafe Has Launched</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/options-cafe-has-launched/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jan 2019 20:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/options-cafe-has-launched/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have some big news!!

What an unfortunate month for &lt;a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">Put Credit Spreads&lt;/a>. Afraid this month returned all my yearly gains and then some. A bit of a disappointing way to end the year. We know months like this will happen.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My SPY Put Credit Spread Trades For November 2018</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/my-spy-put-credit-spread-trades-for-november-2018/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2018 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/my-spy-put-credit-spread-trades-for-november-2018/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well, finally an engaging month. Afraid the engagement was in the wrong direction. In November we took some losses. Not a big deal since we have had so many winning past months. However, losses are never fun.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My SPY Put Credit Spread Trades For October 2018</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/my-spy-put-credit-spread-trades-for-october-2018/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Nov 2018 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/my-spy-put-credit-spread-trades-for-october-2018/</guid><description>&lt;p>With October 2018 completed we move on to November.

My SPY &lt;a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">Put Credit Spread&lt;/a> trading strategy only closed one trade this month. Hoping for a creep up in IVR next month.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My SPY Put Credit Spread Trades For July 2018</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/my-spy-put-credit-spread-trades-for-july-2018/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Aug 2018 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/my-spy-put-credit-spread-trades-for-july-2018/</guid><description>&lt;p>July has come and gone.

Since IVR has been pretty low closing this many trades was a darn good thing. Just have to be careful to not trade too big. &lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My SPY Put Credit Spread Trades For May 2018</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/my-spy-put-credit-spread-trades-for-may-2018/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jun 2018 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/my-spy-put-credit-spread-trades-for-may-2018/</guid><description>&lt;p>May 2018 was a winning month for my SPY &lt;a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">Put Credit Spread&lt;/a> trading strategy.

That is all about to change starting with this post. I am once again committed to posting the trades I place monthly. The reason for the absence in trade posting is we have been crazy busy preparing for the launch of our new &lt;a href="https://options.cafe/">trading platform&lt;/a> -- Just not enough hours in the day :(.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Volatility Trading Allows Options Traders To Think Different</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/volatility-trading-allows-options-traders-to-think-different/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Aug 2017 07:16:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/volatility-trading-allows-options-traders-to-think-different/</guid><description>&lt;p>Volatility Trading is a variable in an option pricing model used to determine the theoretical value of an option.
