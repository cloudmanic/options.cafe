Another good month of trading!
Our Put Credit Spreads strategy is looking good! We are officially back to even from our January drawdown. This has been a good lesson in how drawdowns work.

A very winning month. The best part about the month, for me at least, is Oregon had some epic snow. I had some amazing turns in! I digress.....back to options.
Our Put Credit Spreads strategy is looking good! If April is a good month we should be back to even from our January drawdown.

What an unfortunate month for Put Credit Spreads. Afraid this month returned all my yearly gains and then some. A bit of a disappointing way to end the year. We know months like this will happen. Big drawdowns are part of the overall strategy. The key is to take advantage when times are good to build up a stockpile of reserves.

We partied for America's birthday and closed a few profitable trades! Darn good month! July 2018 was another winning month for my SPY Put Credit Spread trading strategy. However, only closing 3 trades for the month is a bit of a sign. Makes me think the market is stalling and might change direction. Low volatility is never a comfortable place to be in. I am starting to prepare for a pull back.</description></item><item><title>My SPY Put Credit Spread Trades For June 2018</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/my-spy-put-credit-spread-trades-for-june-2018/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jul 2018 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/my-spy-put-credit-spread-trades-for-june-2018/</guid><description>June 2018 was another winning month for my SPY Put Credit Spread trading strategy. Since IVR has been pretty low closing this many trades was a darn good thing. Just have to be careful to not trade too big. Overall this was a low number of trades for a month -- hence one might want to start increasing trade size. I would not suggest that. A down draw is always just round the corner.</description></item><item><title>My SPY Put Credit Spread Trades For May 2018</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/my-spy-put-credit-spread-trades-for-may-2018/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jun 2018 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/my-spy-put-credit-spread-trades-for-may-2018/</guid><description>As you can see from my trades in the table below May 2018 was a winning month. This is a great example of good times with this strategy. With my Put Credit Spread Trades strategy we have good months, bad months, and "meh" months. It was a nice surprise to have this good month after a losing month. Helps get back our losses.

Just creeping up in value each day. With volatility so low there were not many opportunities for SPY Put Credit Spread Trades. While I opened a few trades none closed.

A credit spread trade seemed to be the type that works—until rather dramatically it does not. More than once I put on a series of successful trades and then Dr. Jeckyll transformed into his evil alter ego Mr. Hyde and suddenly I was blowing up my account. Clearly, I did not know what I was doing. On the verge of giving up, I convinced myself that I was just missing something.</description></item><item><title>Should I Consider Delta When Opening SPY Put Credit Spreads?</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/should-i-consider-delta-when-opening-spy-put-credit-spreads/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2015 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/should-i-consider-delta-when-opening-spy-put-credit-spreads/</guid><description>Delta is a metric that options traders use to predict how the price of an option will change when the underlying stock moves by one dollar. If, for example, a call option has a delta of .3 and the underlying stock value increases from $100 to $101, then theoretically that call option would increase in value by $0.30.
Delta is also a probability proxy. You can think of delta as the probability the option will expire in the money—so in other words that call option with a delta of .</description></item><item><title>Being Hyperfocused on the SPY</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/being-hyperfocused-on-the-spy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2015 19:57:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/being-hyperfocused-on-the-spy/</guid><description>Almost all of my credit spread trading is focused on the S&amp;amp;P 500 via the SPY or S&amp;amp;P 500 futures. Why am I hyperfocused on the SPY? So I can sleep at night (well, try to sleep—I do have a young son and a daughter on the way). The S&amp;amp;P 500 is such a big index that it generally doesn’t move dramatically. In contrast, Netflix recently posted a 31% change in a single week, which is just too much for me to handle.</description></item><item><title>How Often the SPY Falls More Than 5% in a 30-Day Period and Why You Should Care</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/how-often-the-spy-falls-more-than-5-in-a-30-day-period-and-why-you-should-care/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2015 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/how-often-the-spy-falls-more-than-5-in-a-30-day-period-and-why-you-should-care/</guid><description>During any 30-day period from 1993 through 2014 the SPY (the Exchange Traded Funds, or ETFs, tracking the S&amp;amp;P 500) closed down 5% or more 11% of the time. I know this obscure fact because for every one of the 5,502 trading days during that period I compared the SPY closing price with the closing price 30 trading days later. (My results can be found here.)
And that’s not all: Further examination of 30-day periods that closed down more than 5% within shorter time frames (say 3 years) revealed rates as high as 20% during extreme bear markets (hello real estate meltdown) and as low as 3% during bull markets.</description></item></channel></rss>
