A very winning month. The best part about the month, for me at least, is Oregon had some epic snow. I had some amazing turns in! I digress.....back to options.&lt;/p>

These wins really helped build back up our drawdown from past months.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My SPY Put Credit Spread Trades For January 2019</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/my-spy-put-credit-spread-trades-for-january-2019/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Feb 2019 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/my-spy-put-credit-spread-trades-for-january-2019/</guid><description>&lt;p>More losses this month for our &lt;a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">Put Credit Spreads&lt;/a> strategy. Mainly a losing trade that was put on in 2018 and crossed over. I &lt;strong>think&lt;/strong> the markets are calming down and we will start to draw back up.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My SPY Put Credit Spread Trades For December 2018</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/my-spy-put-credit-spread-trades-for-december-2018/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jan 2019 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/my-spy-put-credit-spread-trades-for-december-2018/</guid><description>&lt;p>Wow! What an unfortunate month for &lt;a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">Put Credit Spreads&lt;/a>. Afraid this month returned all my yearly gains and then some. A bit of a disappointing way to end the year. We know months like this will happen.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My SPY Put Credit Spread Trades For November 2018</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/my-spy-put-credit-spread-trades-for-november-2018/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2018 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/my-spy-put-credit-spread-trades-for-november-2018/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well, finally an engaging month. Afraid the engagement was in the wrong direction. In November we took some losses. Not a big deal since we have had so many winning past months. However, losses are never fun.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My SPY Put Credit Spread Trades For October 2018</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/my-spy-put-credit-spread-trades-for-october-2018/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Nov 2018 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/my-spy-put-credit-spread-trades-for-october-2018/</guid><description>&lt;p>With October 2018 completed we move on to November.

Traders leave their Hamptons pads and get back to work. My SPY &lt;a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">Put Credit Spread&lt;/a> trading strategy only closed one trade this month. Hoping for a creep up in IVR next month.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My SPY Put Credit Spread Trades For July 2018</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/my-spy-put-credit-spread-trades-for-july-2018/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Aug 2018 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/my-spy-put-credit-spread-trades-for-july-2018/</guid><description>&lt;p>July has come and gone. We partied for America's birthday and closed a few profitable trades! Darn good month! My SPY &lt;a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">Put Credit Spread&lt;/a> trading strategy continued to do well.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My SPY Put Credit Spread Trades For June 2018</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/my-spy-put-credit-spread-trades-for-june-2018/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jul 2018 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/my-spy-put-credit-spread-trades-for-june-2018/</guid><description>&lt;p>June 2018 was another winning month for my SPY &lt;a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">Put Credit Spread&lt;/a> trading strategy. Since IVR has been pretty low closing this many trades was a darn good thing. Just have to be careful to not trade too big. &lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My SPY Put Credit Spread Trades For May 2018</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/my-spy-put-credit-spread-trades-for-may-2018/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jun 2018 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/my-spy-put-credit-spread-trades-for-may-2018/</guid><description>&lt;p>May 2018 was a winning month for my SPY &lt;a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">Put Credit Spread&lt;/a> trading strategy. It felt good to lock away some winning trades after last month.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My SPY Put Credit Spread Trades For April 2018</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/my-spy-put-credit-spread-trades-for-april-2018/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 May 2018 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/my-spy-put-credit-spread-trades-for-april-2018/</guid><description>&lt;p>April 2018 was a losing month for my SPY &lt;a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">Put Credit Spread&lt;/a> trading strategy. While these months are never fun they serve as an opportunity to remember to be humble in this trading strategy. &lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My SPY Put Credit Spread Trades For March 2018</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/my-spy-put-credit-spread-trades-for-march-2018/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Apr 2018 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/my-spy-put-credit-spread-trades-for-march-2018/</guid><description>&lt;p>Here we explore the put credit spread trades I placed on the SPY durning the month of March 2018. This is my primary trading strategy for &lt;a href="https://options.cafe/blog/related-topics/monthly-income">monthly income&lt;/a>. By trading put credit spreads on the &lt;a href="https://options.cafe/blog/related-topics/spy">SPY&lt;/a> I am typically in a trade for 23 days but no more than 45 days.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My SPY Put Credit Spread Trades For February 2018</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/my-spy-put-credit-spread-trades-for-february-2018/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Mar 2018 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/my-spy-put-credit-spread-trades-for-february-2018/</guid><description>&lt;p>Volatility is back! Seems the day of the market just creeping up every day are over. In February 2018 the market tanked creating tons of new opportunities for entering &lt;a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">Put Credit Spread&lt;/a> trades. Sadly, we took some losses but in this post I explain that is not a bad thing. &lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My SPY Put Credit Spread Trades For January 2018 (or lack there of)</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/my-spy-put-credit-spread-trades-for-january-2018-or-lack-there-of/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Feb 2018 04:11:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/my-spy-put-credit-spread-trades-for-january-2018-or-lack-there-of/</guid><description>&lt;p>In January 2018 the markets where pretty stable -- Well stable in the eyes of an options volatility trader. It was not until the end of January when the market made a turn and volatility came back into the market. I opened a few trades in January 2018 but none closed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Baseline Strategy for Trading SPY Put Credit Spreads</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/baseline-strategy-for-trading-spy-put-credit-spreads/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2015 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/baseline-strategy-for-trading-spy-put-credit-spreads/</guid><description>&lt;p>When I got interested in trading credit spreads, like most I harbored some &lt;a href="https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/shows/truth-or-skepticism-with-dylan-ratigan">skepticism&lt;/a>. A credit spread trade seemed to be the type that works—until rather dramatically it does not. Then I set off to figure out the correct way to trade SPY put credit spreads. The path was familiar: backtesting.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Should I Consider Delta When Opening SPY Put Credit Spreads?</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/should-i-consider-delta-when-opening-spy-put-credit-spreads/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2015 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/should-i-consider-delta-when-opening-spy-put-credit-spreads/</guid><description>&lt;p>To study how delta affects an opening trade I did—of course—some backtesting. I took a $10,000 account and placed put credit spread trades from 2011 to current. I opened up spreads that were $2 wide, at least 4% out of the money, and no more than 45 days to expiration. &lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Being Hyperfocused on the SPY</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/being-hyperfocused-on-the-spy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2015 19:57:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/being-hyperfocused-on-the-spy/</guid><description>&lt;p>Almost all of my &lt;a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/12/what-is-so-special-about-option-credit-spreads">credit spread trading&lt;/a> is focused on the S&amp;amp;P 500 via the &lt;a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q;_ylt=Am8D.cM4hnyWoRrbzGOgBWYByr0F?uhb=uhb2&amp;amp;fr=uh3_finance_vert_gs&amp;amp;type=2button&amp;amp;s=spy">SPY&lt;/a> or S&amp;amp;P 500 futures. Why am I hyperfocused on the SPY? So I can sleep at night (well, try to sleep—I do have a young son and a daughter on the way). &lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How Often the SPY Falls More Than 5% in a 30-Day Period and Why You Should Care</title><link>https://options.cafe/blog/how-often-the-spy-falls-more-than-5-in-a-30-day-period-and-why-you-should-care/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2015 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://options.cafe/blog/how-often-the-spy-falls-more-than-5-in-a-30-day-period-and-why-you-should-care/</guid><description>&lt;p>During any 30-day period from 1993 through 2014 the &lt;a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SPY">SPY&lt;/a> (the Exchange Traded Funds, or ETFs, tracking the S&amp;amp;P 500) closed down 5% or more 11% of the time.
