That might sound like a term that belongs in a World War II documentary, but itâ€™s actually a very effective options trading strategy. With an iron condor, you utilize four different options contracts, or legs, to profit off of relatively stable stock prices. This is a bit different from most investment strategies, which typically rely on asset prices moving up or down. For investors, however, the ability to generate returns off of stable markets, or sideways prices movements as they are often called, adds yet another tool to the investing tool box.</description></item></channel></rss>
