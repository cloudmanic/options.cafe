                <description
      ><![CDATA[
                    
                      <p>Anytime a stock looks headed for a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/drawdown.asp">drawdown</a>, a good option technique that can profit from this price movement is the bear call spread. The derivative play receives a net credit at the commencement of the trade, and this profit will be the maximum the strategy earns if the stock sinks below the short call’s strike price. </p>
<h2>Details of the Bear Call Spread</h2>
<p>There are two legs in a bear call spread, and as the name implies, each one is a call option. One is short, and the other is long. The written contract has a lower strike price. Both contracts have the same expiration date and underlying equity. The long contract is purchased out-of-the-money, while the short option is sold in-the-money. This means the bear call spread has an assignment risk from the very beginning. <br /></p>
<p>Despite this hazard, the trade receives a net credit at the entry point. The hope is that the stock price will decline below the strike price of the short call, sending it OTM. </p>
<p>Here is an example of placing an order for a bear call spread on the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY">SPY</a>:</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width1200/Image-2019-07-17-at-10.33.38-AM.png?mtime=20190717103515" alt="" /></figure><p>Here is an example of the profit and loss graph for this trade.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width1200/Image-2019-07-17-at-10.33.58-AM.png?mtime=20190717103556" alt="" /></figure><p>Option assignments are frequently related to dividends, so keep an eye on the ex-dividend date of the underlying equity. Short calls are frequently assigned right before the ex-dividend date of a stock; therefore, be sure to verify the stock’s dividend schedule when creating a bear call spread. </p>
<h2>Example of a Bear Call Spread</h2>
<p>In order for a bear call spread to remain profitable at the expiration of the two contracts, the underlying stock price needs to retreat below the strike price of the short call. This typically isn’t very far, as the strike price may only be a few dollars or even less from the stock price at the start of the trade. A major collapse in stock price isn’t necessary; in fact, a bear call spread will earn just as much as if the stock only retreated below the short call’s strike price. There isn’t a third leg in the trade that increases in price if the stock declines substantially.</p>
<p>You begin looking for stocks that you think are overvalued and therefore might decline in price in the near future. The stock screener that is available on your broker’s website has a feature that allows you to look for equities that have a high amount of short interest. This means that many investors are shorting the stock. Such bearish sentiment indicates a high degree of confidence that such a stock is overbought.</p>
<p>You see that <a href="https://www.netflix.com">Netflix</a> has a lot of bearish interest. Although the stock has a great performance history, many investors think the price is too high and is set for a pull back. You analyze the stock using both fundamental and technical methods. You see that the company is not set to pay a dividend within the next four weeks. Based on your research, you decide that NFLX is a good candidate for a price decline in the near future. </p>
<h2>Submitting the Order</h2>
<p>You’re fairly confident in your analysis of Netflix, so you decide to trade three contracts per leg. You sell three call options with a strike price of $187.50. Netflix is currently trading at $188.50, so these written contracts are ITM. The sale earns $6.50 per share. With three contracts, that’s a total inflow of $1,950 (300 × $6.50). </p>
<p>The second and final leg is a long call with a $190 strike price. The cost is $5.20 per share, for a total expenditure of $1,560. Because this leg has a lower cost than the first, the bear call spread earns a profit at the outset. The details of the trade are seen in the following table, for a net credit of $390:</p>
<blockquote>Short NFLX 187.50 Call @ 6.50 $1,950 </blockquote>
<blockquote>Long NFLX 190.00 Call @ -5.20 -$1,560</blockquote>
<p>The contracts expire in four weeks. The hope is that the short contract, which is ITM immediately, isn’t assigned before the stock retreats below $187.50. </p>
<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>Going into the first week, Netflix experiences quite a bit of volatility. The price reaches a low of $187 on the third day of the trade, which puts the short option OTM. This is what you were hoping for, and you can close the trade at this point by buying to close the short contract and selling to close the long one. Choosing this route so early in the trade, however, will be very expensive because there’s a lot of time value left in the contracts. You look at this possibility and see that the price would be $370, leaving you with just a $20 profit, not considering commissions, which will exceed $20. So you decide to leave the trade as it is. </p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width1200/bear-call-spread.jpg?mtime=20190717102111" alt="" /></figure><p>The second week, Netflix experiences less volatility, although it moves back above $187.50. Now the short contract is assignable once again. Going into the third week, investors continue to push NFLX higher, sending it to $189. </p>
<p>You become concerned at this point that you may receive an assignment. If this happens, you can meet your obligation in one of two ways. You can either go into the market and purchase 300 shares of Netflix and sell them to your counterparty, or you can exercise your long call at $190.00 and use those shares for the assignment. Since the stock is under $189, you would buy in the market. </p>
<p>The fourth and final week shows up, and robust trading activity continues to send the stock higher. NFLX reaches $191 by the end of the week, and you receive an assignment on the last day of the trade. You exercise your long call, which allows you to purchase the stock at a cheaper $190. After buying these shares, you immediately sell them at $187.50 to meet your assignment. </p>
<h2>Determining the Loss</h2>
<p>This trade is definitely going to result in a loss because the stock went in the opposite direction that you were expecting. The total loss can be discovered with the following equation:</p>
<blockquote>Net credit – Long call exercise + Short call assignment – commissions = Loss</blockquote>
<blockquote>$390 – $57,000 + $56,250 = -$360</blockquote>
<p>It’s a $360 loss before commissions are thrown into the equation. If you had exited the trade after the first week, you would have saved over $300. Don’t forget that the IRS will allow you to use this capital loss to offset capital gains in the same tax year. And excess capital losses can be carried forward for future tax years. </p>
<h2>Stock Market and Options Market</h2>
<p>One of the lessons we can gain from this hypothetical trade is that the stock market can never be divorced from the options market. While the derivative trade looked good on paper, trading activity in NFLX created an unprofitable environment. While the market price of Netflix may be in a bubble, you don’t get to buy and sell based on fundamental value. Options reflect market value, not fundamental value. Whatever the actual worth of NFLX, buyers and sellers decide what the stock price is going to be, and this impacts option prices.</p>
<h2>Vital Points</h2>
<p>The maximum gain a bear call spread can earn is the net credit received at the start of the trade. Commissions will lower this limit. This maximum point is achieved if the market price of the underlying equity is below or equal to the strike price of the written contract. </p>
<p>The highest possible loss is the difference between the options’ strike prices minus the net premium earned. Trading fees should also be added to increase the maximum loss. </p>
<p>There is one breakeven point. It is the short option’s strike price plus the net credit per share.</p>

      ><![CDATA[
                    
                      <p>If you are reading this blog post you most likely have a good understanding of what an option is. If you don't, maybe start by reading these posts:</p>
<ul><li>
<a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-call-option">What Is a Call Option?</a>
</li><li><a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-option">What Is a Put Option?</a></li><li><a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">What Is a Put Credit Spread?</a></li>
</ul><p>Most people get interested in options trading as a leveraged bet on a stock trade. An options contract controls 100 shares of an underlying stock. If I wanted to purchase 100 shares of the <a href="https://ycharts.com/companies/SPY">SPY</a> it would cost me around $27,600 (based on today’s price). Or I could buy one SPY <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atthemoney.asp">at the money</a> call option for around $311. </p>
<p>Let’s say the SPY goes up in value by $5.00. My stock holdings would be worth $28,100, a profit of $500. On the other hand, my options trade would go to $500 (assuming no time value premium). If I subtract out the original $311 cost, I would have a profit of $189.</p>

  </a>  
</p>
                    
                      <p>In one trade I risked $27,600 to make $500, and in the other trade, I risked $311 to make $189. Seems like a no brainer to just trade options instead of stock. Options provide a lot of built-in leverage. This is how newer options traders tend to think. While there are valid strategies trading options as such, I submit it is very hard to maintain a consistent monthly income trading options in this form. <br /><br />The above strategy requires you to be correct on the direction of the stock (and in the case of options, to be right on the timing of that direction). We all know the stock market is pretty random. It is very hard to predict where the market is going and when. <br /><br />For these reasons, many options traders are turning to a strategy of trading credit spreads using options.</p>
                    
                      <h2>What is a Credit Spread Option?</h2>
                    
                      <p>A credit spread option is an act of taking two or more options and selling the premium they produce. Yes, that sounds confusing. I'll explain, but first, let's explore quickly the concept of writing a contract. </p>
<p>Instead of buying the SPY call option I mentioned above for $311 let's say I wrote the contract. By writing this contract someone would pay me $311 in exchange for the right to buy from me 100 shares of the SPY at a certain price in the future. I am more or less selling insurance. Someone gives me $311 today to ensure they can fix the price to buy the SPY in the future. Should the SPY not reach the strike price of the option I keep the $311. If the option expires <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inthemoney.asp">in the money</a> I have to deliver the SPY shares (meaning I lose money).</p>
<p>With that explained, how about the idea of selling one option while buying another. Let’s look at the credit spread trade I trade most, a <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">put credit spread</a>. For easy numbers let’s assume the SPY is trading at a price of $250. Let's assume today is September 1st. I could open the following trade.</p>
<blockquote>Buy: SPY Nov 14 2018 $233.00 Put @ 1.00</blockquote>
<blockquote>Sell: SPY Nov 14 2018 $235.00 Put @ 1.25</blockquote>
<p>Simultaneously, I am buying an out of the money (OTM) put option and writing (selling) an OTM put option with a higher strike. Since the higher strike is closer to being in the money (ITM) it sells for more money. Combining these trades I collect a credit of .25 (or $25). The option I am selling would bring in a credit of $125 but I have to use the credit to pay the $100 for the second option.</p>
                    
                      <p>
    <a href="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/profit-loss-graph-credit-spread-options.png?mtime=20190601163603">
      <img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width1000/profit-loss-graph-credit-spread-options.png?mtime=20190601163603" style="width: 100%; float: none; display: block; margin: 0px auto;" alt="Profit Loss Graph Credit Spread Options" />
  </a>  
</p>
                    
                      <p>The graph above does a good job of visualizing this trade. The x-axis is the price of the SPY on November 14th, 2018. The y-axis is the profit based on the possible outcomes of the final SPY price. As a reminder, option pricing is the price of one share but every contract is really 100 shares. So when the chart shows $0.25 that means $25.00 (0.25 * 100) in your brokerage account. Also, we are assuming you are trading just one contract here. If for example, you could trade 20 contracts (10 on the short side and 10 on the long side) you would have $250 instead of $25.</p>
<p>I found <a href="https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/put-spread.html">optionsprofitcalculator.com</a> and <a href="https://optioncreator.com">Option Creator</a> to be rather useful for understanding how pricing works with credit spreads.</p>
                    
                      <h2>Guessing Market Direction is a Fools Game</h2>
                    
                      <p>Continuing with the trade mentioned above let’s explore the risk we just put on. November 14th is around 45 days in the future. At the end of 45 days if the SPY is $235 or higher I get to keep the $25 credit I collected. If the SPY is below $235 I start to lose money. </p>
<p>Downside protection is why I purchased the second option. If the SPY falls lower than $233 that option will kick in and protect me. Our maximum loss is $200 ($235-$233 * 100), plus the $25 we received as a credit. Meaning the most we can lose on this trade is $175.<br /></p>

      <img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width1000/dont-be-a-fool-when-trading.png?mtime=20190601173159" style="width: 100%; float: none; display: block; margin: 0px auto;" alt="Dont Be A Fool When Trading" />
  </a>  
</p>
                    
                      <p>As a quick side note, the SPY does not drop more than 5% often. Take a look at, <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/how-often-the-spy-falls-more-than-5-in-a-30-day-period-and-why-you-should-care">How Often the SPY Falls More Than 5% in a 30-Day Period and Why You Should Care</a> to learn more.</p>
<p>Why do I like this style of the trade so much? Often when you are collecting a premium (a credit) you only have to worry about an extreme move in the underlying stock. In the example above, I simply do not care if the stock price of the SPY goes up, stays flat, or goes down a little. I just care that the SPY does not drop in value below $235. I do not need a crystal ball to tell me where the market is going. I just need the market to not have wild swings.</p>
                    
                      <h2>Best Stock to Trade Credit Spreads on</h2>
                    
                      <p>In the example above we mainly looked at trading the SPY which is the ETF tracking the S&amp;P 500. We can place credit spread option trades on just about any stock, however, there are some that are better than others. When selecting an underlying stock you want to make sure there is plenty of volume in the options market. Volume, often related to <a href="https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/learn/liquidity">liquidity</a>, is key to this type of trading. The main reason is without liquidity the gap between the bid and the asking price can be rather large. For example, if you can buy an option for $1.00 but you can only write an option for $0.20 the math would not work out. You really want the bid and ask prices to be very close together. A great example is in the screenshot below. That is a more reasonable bid and ask spread.</p>
                    
                      <p>

  </a>  
</p>
                    
                      <p>Most traders like high volume ETF. My personal favorite is the SPY (as I am sure you have guessed by now). However, here is a list of popular stocks on which people often trade credit spread options.</p>
<ul><li><strong>SPY</strong>: ETF S&amp;P 500</li><li><strong>QQQ</strong>: Nonfinancial stocks listed on NASDAQ (mainly tech stocks)</li><li><strong>IWM</strong>: ETF Russell 2000</li><li><strong>AAPL</strong>: Apple</li><li><strong>NFLX</strong>: Netflix</li><li><strong>AMZN</strong>: Amazon</li><li><strong>GOOGL</strong>: Alphabet (Google)</li><li><strong>XOM</strong>: Exxon Mobile</li><li><strong>TSLA</strong>: Tesla</li>
</ul><p>The list above is a short list, there are many stocks you can trade. I give you this list so you can compare other stocks you are considering trading against this list to see if they exhibit the same characteristics. <br /><br />As a quick aside I would like to mention I am not a big fan of trading individual stocks without a reason. I might trade credit spreads on individual stocks going into an earnings announcement or something but not day to day. One wrong news headline and a stock can make a wild swing in price. I much prefer ETFs on big indexes (such as SPY or QQQ). While ETFs can have swings, they tend to be much smaller in directional change.</p>
                    
                      <h2>Drawdowns when Trading Spreads in the Options Market</h2>
                    
                      <p>If you have made it this far you might have the impression that credit spreads are an amazing way to make money quickly. Let’s take off our rose color glasses and look at reality. Typically a credit spread option strategy will lead to many wins where you profit a little, and a few losses where you lose a lot of money. To profit, you need to make sure your little wins outpaces your big losses. You will have losses--it is only a matter of time. This is called a drawdown period. I share my put credit spread trades on our blog via the category “<a href="https://options.cafe/blog/spicers-trades">Spicer’s Trades</a>.” I highly recommend you look through the different months and get an idea of what a drawdown looks like vs. a successful month. <br /></p>
                    
                      <p>

  </a>  
</p>
                    
                      <p>The best options traders tend to trade a very small percentage of their account size per trade, but place a big number of trades. It is highly recommended to keep each trade to somewhere around 5% of your planned capital. I have been known to go a little higher on more stable ETFs such as the SPY but I tend to do this with money that is a result of profit, not capital I put into the account from other earnings.</p>
                    
                      <h2>Trading Options where you Receive a Credit is DaBomb!</h2>
                    
                      <p>I hope I did well above in highlighting some of the benefits of trading options where you receive a credit vs. buy and hope the price goes up. Personally, I find it so liberating and stress-free to not have to worry about the direction of the market. Once again when trading credit spreads you can often build a strategy where you only lose in the case of a drastic move in the underlying stock price.</p>
<p>For some parting words, I would suggest if you are new to options trading, you start out small. Maybe <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/a-quick-guide-to-paper-trading-options-and-newbie-investing">paper trade</a> for a while before committing real capital and when you do commit real capital assume you will lose it all. Personally, I have blown up many accounts before learning how to trade these strategies profitably. Once you figure out the correct strategy and learn to size your trades profitably, you will never want to buy and pray again.</p>

<p>The short calendar spread has two legs. It can be traded with puts, but our example here will use calls. Both contracts should have the same underlying stock. The first one is going to be long. It will expire in half the time as the next leg, which is short. If the long call has three weeks of life, the short call should have six weeks. This means the written call has more time value; thus, the short calendar spread will always be entered for a net credit.</p>
<p>The default setup uses the same strike price. This is called the <a href="http://www.optionstrading.org/basics/spreads/horizontal">horizontal spread</a>. It is acceptable to use different strike prices. This is known as a diagonal spread. We’ll use the horizontal method in our example. Both contracts will be at- or near-the-money. Here’s the set up:</p>
<blockquote>Buy 1 ABC near 105 call</blockquote>
<blockquote>Sell 1 ABC far 105 call </blockquote>
<p>You won’t be able to capture any intrinsic value in this strategy because both options (one long and one short) have the same strike. However, if you were to go with the diagonal spread you could establish intrinsic value in the strategy. </p>
<h2>Maximums and Breakeven Points</h2>
<p>The maximum profit the short call calendar spread can earn is the premium received at the beginning of the trade, minus commissions. This maximum will be achieved on the expiration date of the near contract if the equity price is far above or far below the strike price. </p>
<p>While the long call is live, the <a href="http://www.plaintrading.com/en/index.php/faqs/56-1-how-can-i-change-something-in-my-order">maximum risk</a> occurs if the equity price equals the strike price on the expiration date of the long call. In this situation, the difference in premiums between the long and short calls is at its greatest. The exact amount of the loss cannot be known for sure because the price of the short call can vary as a result of several issues—namely Greek values, which we will look at shortly. <br /></p>

  </a>  
</p>
                    
                      <p>The short calendar play has two breakeven spots at the long call’s <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expirationdate.asp">expiration</a>. One is above the strike, while the other is below. After the expiration of the first contract, you end up with a naked short call (assuming you don’t own shares of the underlying stock). Here, the maximum loss is unlimited because the equity could in theory rise indefinitely. The breakeven price on the uncovered short call is the option’s strike plus the premium received.</p>
<h2>Reasons to Choose the Short Call Calendar Spread</h2>
<p>Because the first half of the trade profits when a stock moves quite a bit either up or down, the short calendar call play would be ideal if you’re expecting a high amount of volatility, but aren’t certain which direction it will be in. Often traders find themselves in this situation when a company is about to release earnings. Stocks often move significantly, to the upside or downside, after these types of announcements.</p>
<p>Since you’ll be left with an uncovered short call when the first option expires, you’ll want to find a stock that you’re bearish on longer term. You could of course buy another call when the first one expires in order to check the short call, but doing so will offset the premium you earned at the start of the original trade. A third option would be to buy to close the second leg mid-way through the trade. If the premium is low enough, and it may not be, you would be left with a small profit.</p>
<h2>Don’t Forget the Risks</h2>
<p>There’s a short option in the calendar spread under discussion, and this is where you’re going to find difficulties in options trading. During the first half of the trade, if the stock experiences a bull run the short contract will go in-the-money, and you may receive an assignment. Short options in the United States can be assigned any market day, so you’ll definitely need to be prepared in this situation.</p>
<p>If you do receive an assignment, you’ll have to sell 100 shares of the underlying stock for each contract that is exercised. If you don’t already own the stock, the sale will create a short stock position, which has its own hazards. These include margin calls, margin interest, and buy-ins. Assuming you hang onto your long call, you’ll actually have a protective call position (this is composed of a long call and a short stock).</p>
<p>With the protective call, you’ll have a small loss if the stock rises. The loss is actually from the cost of the option, which you have already purchased in this case.<br /></p>
                    
                      <p>

  </a>  
</p>
                    
                      <p>If the stock declines, you will experience a very nice profit. Obviously, this position should be maintained only if you’re bearish until the expiration of the long option. If not, there are two methods to get out of it. You can either exercise your long call and this will eliminate both the call and the stock (you’re buying to cover the short stock position); or you’ll need to buy to cover the stock and sell to close the option.</p>
<p>Because the written option has a longer life in the short calendar play, it’s possible to receive an assignment after your long call has expired. In this case, you’ll have to sell short 100 shares per contract as in the front-end scenario. But here, you won’t have a long call to help you get rid of the stock. If you’re bearish on the stock, you can simply maintain this trade and accept the standard risks of shorting. Otherwise, you’ll need to buy to cover the shares the following business day, and the price could be far from where you shorted.</p>
<p>Given all of this complexity, the short call calendar spread should only be attempted by experienced option traders.</p>
<h2>First, You Need to Find a Good Stock</h2>
<p>Before going into the short calendar spread, you’ll want to decide how you plan to handle the second half of the trade. The goal in the first half of the trade is price movement in either direction. In the second half, you’re going to be looking for a move to the downside—if you decide to stay in the trade.</p>
<p>Although earnings announcements are often the go-to-choice of traders in a short calendar spread, there is another method that can be chosen. The U.S. government releases economic reports at scheduled intervals, and these can impact the price of a stock. For example, announcements on building permits and housing starts could affect the price of home builders.</p>
<p>The federal government is scheduled to releases housing data in seven days. During this time, stocks of home builders will probably remain flat in anticipation; then they should move in accordance with the announcement. You’ll need plenty of time for the stock of your choice to move before the long contract expires. An expiration date of at least two weeks should be enough.</p>
<p>Looking at the derivatives of various housing stocks, you see that D. R. Horton has high open interest in both two-week and four-week contracts. But first, we’ll need to look at the Greek values.</p>
<h2>Check the Greeks First Before Placing a Trade</h2>
<p>Greeks are numbers that help derivative traders see how valuable or invaluable a particular contract is. Because modern software programs calculate these numbers for you, they’re all the more useful.</p>
<p>Delta is one of the more <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/university/options-pricing/greeks.asp">popular Greeks</a> and it can help you analyze a short calendar spread. Delta tells you how much an option’s premium will move for each movement of a stock. A long call has a positive delta (between 0.0 and 1.0), while a short call has a negative delta. Net delta is calculated by adding all of the deltas of a strategy together. For the short call calendar spread, it is usually close to zero. As expiration gets closer, the net delta of a short calendar call spread will vary from -0.50 to 0.50.<br /></p>
                    
                      <p>
    <a href="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/good-greek.jpg?mtime=20190525115953">
      <img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width1000/good-greek.jpg?mtime=20190525115953" style="width: 100%; float: none; display: block; margin: 0px auto;" alt="Good Greek" />
  </a>  
</p>
                    
                      <p>Theta is another commonly-used Greek. It measures how time erosion affects the price of options. Long contracts have negative theta, while short options have positive theta (because they profit from time erosion). In the calendar spread, the expiration dates differ, and this will affect the net theta.</p>
<h2>Preparing the Order</h2>
<p>Since one leg is long in this trade, and one is short, the cost to enter is small. In fact, as already mentioned, this particular strategy will earn a premium. If you wish, you can trade more than one contract per leg, but be sure to keep the ratio at 1:1. Also remember that for each contract that gets assigned, you’ll have to sell 100 shares of <a href="https://www.drhorton.com">D. R. Horton</a> (ticker symbol DHI), which is trading for $41.60 right now.</p>
<p>You will do eight contracts per leg. The number of options should be easily adjustable using your broker’s order form. Remember to double check the expiration dates before submitting your order.</p>
<p>The closest strike price is $41.50, which means the short calls will be ITM straight away. Here’s the trade result:</p>
<blockquote>Buy 8 DHI 14-day 41.50 calls @ -1.40 -$1,120</blockquote>
<blockquote>Sell 8 DHI 28-day 41.50 calls @ 1.75 $1,400</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Net Credit	$280</strong></blockquote>
<p>It’s a decent $280 profit before a $15 commission is considered.</p>
<h2>Trade Result</h2>
<p>Because the short calls are ITM, you need to decide now how you will handle an assignment. In the short calendar play, you have long calls of the same stock, and you can use these to cover a short stock position.</p>
<p>During the first week, DHI moves sideways between $41.20 and $41.70. This is about what you expected in the lead up to the economic report.</p>
<p>On Tuesday of the second week, the government reports a significant uptick in the number of housing starts and building permits issued. As a result, traders send DHI up to $43. While it’s good that the stock is moving, the short calls are now deeper ITM.</p>
<p>As of Friday approaches, DHI continues climbing, and the long calls are getting closer to their expiration date. Most brokers in the United States will automatically exercise any contract on its expiration day if it is in the money by $0.01 or more. If you don’t want your ITM options exercised (for example, you don’t want to take on shares of the stock) you can call your broker and request the contracts not be exercised. Or you can sell to close the calls before expiration, and this would generate a profit. Obviously, the second choice is preferable.</p>
<p>In the short calendar spread, exercising the near calls is advantageous because it gives you the shares you’ll need to fulfill your obligation on the short leg if it is exercised. Because the short call is in-the-money in our example, this is probably the wisest choice here.<br /></p>
                    
                      <p>
    <a href="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/good-results.jpg?mtime=20190525120213">
      <img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width1000/good-results.jpg?mtime=20190525120213" style="width: 100%; float: none; display: block; margin: 0px auto;" alt="Good Results" />
  </a>  
</p>
                    
                      <p>Friday evening, your broker gives you 800 shares of DHI and charges you $33,200. You’re going to have to pay margin interest on this because you don’t have the cash in your account to buy the shares.</p>
<p>On Monday morning, D. R. Horton continues its advance, and this move puts the short calls further ITM. As the short leg gains more intrinsic value, it becomes more likely that you will receive an assignment eventually. In this situation, you could go ahead and close out the short contracts; but since you purchased the stock, you decide to wait it out. Buying to close the short contracts will cost a pretty premium at this point because they are so valuable.</p>
<p>D. R. Horton stabilizes at $48 during the final week of the trade, and you receive an assignment after the market closes on Friday. This earns you $33,200 (800 shares × $41.50), and the stock position is closed.</p>
<h2>Finding the Bottom Line</h2>
<p>There were several events during the life of this example. You entered with one trade consisting of two legs with a total of 16 contracts. You then had an automatic exercise, which cost $20. The margin loan was a total of $110. Finally, you received an assignment on the short leg, and this was another $20 fee. Plugging these figures into the following equation will give you the bottom line:</p>
<p>Net credit – Stock purchase – Margin interest + Stock sale – Commissions = Bottom line</p>
<p>$280 – $33,200 – $110 + $33,200 – $55 = <strong>$115</strong></p>
<p>It’s a decent gain of $115. Carrying the stock on margin for two weeks cost almost the same amount.</p>

                      <p>More losses this month for our <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">Put Credit Spreads</a> strategy. Mainly a losing trade that was put on in 2018 and crossed over. I <strong>think</strong> the markets are calming down and we will start to draw back up. We did have one winning trade which felt good. Take the little wins :). </p>
                    
                      <div class="table"><table><tbody><tr><th width="59">Ticker</th><th width="50">Type</th><th width="109">Spread</th><th width="85">Expire Date</th><th width="79">Open Date</th><th width="90">Closed Date</th><th width="87">Open Credit</th><th width="94">Closed Debit</th><th width="78">Profit / Loss</th></tr><tr><td>SPY</td> <td>Put</td> <td>261/263</td> <td>01/04/2019</td> <td>12/04/18</td> <td>01/04/19</td> <td>$0.23</td> <td>$0.00</td> <td><strong class="red-text">-100%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>SPY</td> <td>Put</td> <td>242/244</td> <td>01/18/2019</td> <td>12/14/18</td> <td>01/11/19</td> <td>$0.23</td> <td>$0.03</td> <td><strong>11.3%</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
                    
                      <p>One thing to note. The trade above that had a closing debit of $0.00 and 100% loss I let expire. I just could not find a good exit point. <br /></p>

                      <p>I have some big news!! Today, we are officially announcing the launch of <a href="https://options.cafe/">Options Cafe</a>. You can now use our platform to make options trades via <a href="https://tradier.com/">Tradier</a>. No other trading platform allows you to discover, trade, and review your trades like Options Cafe. We have built Options Cafe from the ground up with one thing in mind — making multi-leg options trading a snap. I think we have built the options platform you have been yearning for.</p>
                    
                      <p>

      <img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width1000/options-cafe-dashboard.png?mtime=20190127115145" style="width: 100%; float: none; display: block; margin: 0px auto;" alt="Options Cafe Dashboard" />
  </a>  
</p>
                    
                      <p>Before I wow you with all the amazing features Options Cafe offers, I thought I would lead with some very exciting news. As part of our launch, we have partnered with <a href="https://brokerage.tradier.com">Tradier</a> to provide brokerage services. With this partnership, we are able to provide commission-free stock and options trades included in your subscription to Options Cafe. For $60 a month or $600 a year, you can trade as much as you want and never pay a dime in commissions. Our service pays for itself in just a few trades. This deal works for both incoming and current Options Cafe customers.</p>
                    
                      <p>

  </a>  
</p>
                    
                      <p>An options trader with a small $20,000 account might trade 20 <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/iron-condor-explained">iron condor</a> trades a month. So that would be 10 open trades and 10 closing trades for a total of 20 trades. At your current broker, you most likely are paying over $700 a month or $8,000 a year, just in commissions. With Options Cafe, you would only pay $60 / month or $600 / year.<br /></p>

</p>
                    
                      <p>Our partnership with Tradier is for new and current Tradier customers. Once you have created your Options Cafe account and linked your Tradier account, please contact us via <a href="mailto:help@options.cafe">help@options.cafe</a> and we will setup your new pricing.</p>
                    
                      <h2>Discovering Trades With Options Cafe</h2>
                    
                      <p>One of the best features of our platform is discovering your multi-leg trades with only a few clicks. Our easy trade screener allows you to select different configurations, and moments later, Options Cafe will show you all your possible trades. You can save your screener confirmations and come back anytime for an updated trade list. <br /></p>
                    
                      <p>

  </a>  
</p>
                    
                      <p>Once I am happy with my screener, I can save it and possible trades will update in real-time. Every time I visit Options Cafe my saved screens are already updated with possible new trades. Why spend hours every day discovering trades? Review your trades and get on with life! The days of sitting in front of the computer for hours at a time are over.</p>
                    
                      <h2>Managing Open Trades</h2>
                    
                      <p>Trying to manage your multi-leg options trades with traditional stockbroker interfaces is one of the worst experiences. Most of them simply list every option in your portfolio with no grouping for your trade strategy. Many options traders keep spreadsheets just to keep track of their positions. With Option Cafe’s trading dashboard, we group all your trades for you. You can very quickly see the status of your trades. Never again will you have to keep track of which options goes with which strategy.</p>

                      <p>In the screenshot above, you will notice our platform grouped the trade while classifying it as a <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">put credit spread</a>. With a put credit spread, we want to monitor decay of the trade — you will notice the green progress bar gives you a quick view of how far along your trade is to your optimal exit point.</p>
                    
                      <h2>Analyzing Your Performance</h2>
                    
                      <p>As an active options trader, you might make hundreds, or even thousands, of trades each year. With general purpose and jack of all trades brokers, it is very hard to get data about how you are performing beyond simple profit and loss. Our next generation reporting will allow you to zoom in on your trades to discover what strategies are working and what strategies are not. The more we learn from our trades, the better (and more profitable) we will be.</p>

                      <h2>Options Cafe Is In Beta</h2>
                    
                      <p>We are not one of those companies intending to state we are in beta for months or years at a time — but we want to give some warning that for the next few months, we consider Options Cafe in beta. We have no intention of hiding behind this “beta” label for long. Should you have any issues with our platform, please contact us ASAP at <a href="mailto:help@options.cafe">help@options.cafe</a> and we will drop everything to resolve your issue.</p>
<p>Also, we do not support every options strategy known to man just yet. We are adding support for new strategies every week. If you sign up for Options Cafe and you do not see your favorite strategy simply email us at <a href="mailto:help@options.cafe">help@options.cafe</a> and we will prioritize your strategy.</p>
                    
                      <h2>Backtesting Coming</h2>
                    
                      <p>One of the features we are most excited about is backtesting your options strategies. We have some early prototypes of point and click backtesting. Configure a few parameters and within seconds you can see how your favorite strategy would have performed in the past. In many cases, Options Cafe can backtest over 12 years of options trading. </p>
<p>Backtesting is not ready for primetime, and we are focusing on getting our current offering out of beta, but it is coming soon. We are targeting a launch of backtesting by mid-2019. Our pricing will likely change when we launch backtesting. As a thank you to our early adopters, we plan to give special pricing to any current customer at the time of our backtesting release.</p>
                    
                      <h2>Please Send Feedback</h2>
                    
                      <p>The launch of Options Cafe has been something we have been working on for years now. We originally created Options Cafe for our own internal use but realized it was too good not to share with the world. We have been using our platform to make our own trades for years now. With that said, we have existed on our own internal feedback. If we want to make Options Cafe increasingly better, we need your help. Please, at any time send us your thoughts or issues to <a href="mailto:help@options.cafe">help@options.cafe</a>. We promise to move quickly on any issues you might have and will consider deeply any suggestions.</p>
<p>Lastly, if you are new to options trading and just want to get some help, please email me at <a href="mailto:ask@options.cafe">ask@options.cafe</a>. I am more than happy to give you any advice I can provide. You can follow along with my SPY, put credit spread trading strategy via <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SpicersTrades">#SpicersTrades</a>, or my monthly <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/spicers-trades">summaries</a> on this blog. </p>
<p>I hope you love Options Cafe as much as we do. </p>
<p>Happy Trading! </p>

                      <p>Wow! What an unfortunate month for <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">Put Credit Spreads</a>. Afraid this month returned all my yearly gains and then some. A bit of a disappointing way to end the year. We know months like this will happen. Big drawdowns are part of the overall strategy. The key is to take advantage when times are good to build up a stockpile of reserves.</p>

                      <p>After months like this are done, and once I am done soaking my sorrows in whiskey (clearly not the expensive stuff) I typically find time to reflect. I often learn to appreciate losing months like this -- They are humbling. After many profitable months, it is easy to convince yourself this strategy can't fail. As a result, every few weeks I make a point of pulling a report just to see the months with massive losses. Very good to keep this in perspective. I do this via <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/options-cafe-has-launched">Options Cafe's Reports</a> of course.</p>
<p>One thing to note. The trades above that had a closing debit of $0.00 and 100% loss I let expire. I just could not find a good exit point. </p>
<p>Let's hope the New Year brings us better trades!</p>

                      <p>This month was a good month for learning to deal with losses. As you can see from my trades some of my positions took big percent losses. Since I trade rather small this does not matter much. Yes, it erases many months of gains but this is how the strategy goes. We call this a drawdown period. </p>

                      <p>This is how <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">put credit spreads</a> go. Some months are very exciting -- some are just meh. Personally, I really enjoy autumn. There is something special about the change of seasons. I will sit on cash while I watch the foliage change. When the market changes I am ready to trade. </p>

                      <p>July has come and gone. We partied for America's birthday and closed a few profitable trades! Darn good month! July 2018 was another winning month for my SPY <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">Put Credit Spread</a> trading strategy. </p>
<p>However, only closing 3 trades for the month is a bit of a sign. Makes me think the market is stalling and might change direction. Low volatility is never a comfortable place to be in. I am starting to prepare for a pull back.</p>

                      <p>June 2018 was another winning month for my SPY <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">Put Credit Spread</a> trading strategy. Since IVR has been pretty low closing this many trades was a darn good thing. Just have to be careful to not trade too big. Overall this was a low number of trades for a month -- hence one might want to start increasing trade size. I would not suggest that. A down draw is always just round the corner. </p>

                      <p>As we head into summer we should look at market pasts. The summer is often a random time. We have had big drawdowns, or flat "meh" markets. I always take trades when I have them but try to be aware of the over all direction of the market. Sometimes I reduce trade size in the summer if I am unsure. </p>
<p>Do not forget to enjoy the summer time.....but keep an eye on the market as well. </p>

<p>On a side note I am looking forward to summer very much. As I watch the flowers blossom after a long winter I feel renewed. I like to take the summer time to reflect on the last 6 months and prepare for the coming months. </p>

      ><![CDATA[<p>Throughout my investing career, I have always applied my energies to basis reduction and not seeking discounts when buying a position in a company. I love to use call options or put credit spreads to reduce the basis of a core holding. In this post, I will share with you some of my basis reducing ideas.</p>]]></summary>
                <description
      ><![CDATA[
                    
                      <p>Many investors (AKA <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/university/value-investing/value-investing1.asp">value investors</a>) like to buy great companies at a bargain.  Investors such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett">Warren Buffett</a> are famous for sitting on a pile of cash and waiting for a great company’s stock price to drop. When the mentioned event happens, value investors tend to jump into thinking they are buying a great company at a discount. This strategy is fine. It works. Heck, we all know Buffett has gotten stupidly rich with this plan of attack. However, this strategy is not for me.</p>
<p>I think there is one thing all good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investor">investors</a> agree on -- none of us has a clue what the market is going to be like over the next 12 months. If you asked me 18 months ago, I would have guessed the market would have been flat or down and the last 18 months have shown some of the biggest gains ever seen. If I had stayed on the sidelines waiting for a pullback so I could pick up some companies at good prices, I would have missed out on a big gain. That is not to mention all the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/walkthrough/corporate-finance/5/dividends/cash-payment.aspx">dividend</a> payments I would have missed as well. </p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width1000/lower-your-stock-basis-using-options.jpg?mtime=20180529221718" alt="" /></figure><p>Considering the market over the last 18 months is up over 15%, it is very unlikely that our next pullback will be over 15% (granted it has happened in the past). There is a pretty good chance if I waited on the sidelines for a deal, I missed price levels we will never see again.<br /></p>
<p>To combat this problem, many investors turn to <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp">dollar cost averaging</a> -- investing a little bit every month and hoping you average out on a good <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costbasis.asp">basis</a>. While this is a good idea, and I do this at times, it is not my favorite approach. At least, I like to dollar cost average with a twist.</p>
<h2>Using Options To Lower Your Basis</h2>
<p>If you are like me and unwilling to sit around waiting for a discount on your favorite great company you seek out ways to lower your basis in other ways. Take <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN/">Amazon</a> for example. If you are a traditional value investor you have never had a chance to own this company. The stock price has never dropped enough to own this company at a discount and the stock price has grown like a weed over the last 20 years! </p>
<p>I own Amazon and I think I have a pretty good “synthetic” basis. What I call a synthetic basis is the act of generating a profit on a short-term trade and using that profit to buy stock in a great company. </p>
<p>Let's say I want to own $20,000 worth of Amazon, but I want to originate my investment at a discounted price. One thing I might do is to buy a <a href="https://www.optionsplaybook.com/rookies-corner/buying-leap-options/">leap call option</a> on Amazon for $1,000 leaving the other $19,000 in a saving account. With a leap call option, if the stock goes up in value, you are likely to have a big outsized return. If the stock goes down, you are likely to lose the entire $1,000. Of course, if the stock stays flat, you're likely to lose the $1,000 as well.</p>
<p>Since leaps are over a year out to expiration, the $19,000 in the savings account most likely gained some interest to help offset the $1,000 in the case of a complete loss of the $1,000. Also, if the leap expired and became worthless, you avoided a loss in the stock had you invested the entire $20,000 at the start.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width1000/grow-your-money-with-options.jpg?mtime=20180529221933" alt="" /></figure><p>In case the stock goes up in value, the leap likely had many times over again. Let’s say the leap is now worth $4,000. If you were to close out that leap, you would have $23,000 + the interest you earned on the $19,000 in savings (let's say $150). Now you have $23,150 to invest in Amazon. I know what your thinking. If the leap went up in value the stock price of Amazon also did. Maybe it is a wash. This is true. But odds are it is not a wash as leaps have the power of leverage (since one option contract controls 100 shares). <br /></p>
<p>Let’s assume it was a wash. Fine no big deal. Just wait for a pullback in Amazon. Now you're sitting on $23,150 waiting for a good price to enter the trade at. If the stock keeps going you made $3,150 on $20,000 -- not a bad trade anyway.<br /><br />Walking away with the $3,150 is an option but what I would do at this point typically is dollar cost average into the stock. Maybe 10% of the $23,150 every week or month (depending on the market).<br /><br />If this all plays out well I will own Amazon on a reduced basis. I did not have to wait until some pullback. I did not sit on the sidelines waiting for a discount. </p>
<h2>Another Way to Reduce Basis</h2>
<p>My leap buying strategy above was nothing more than one of many tools in my basis reducing toolbox. One strategy I use rather often I refer to as the <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/scaling-your-investments-via-overflow">overflow approach</a>. Since I have mentioned it in other blog posts I will not go into too much detail here. But the basic concept is to take the profits from short-term trades and use them to buy long-term buy and hold positions. I would call this reducing my “synthetic” basis.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width1000/Amazon.com-Logo.png?mtime=20180529222620" alt="" /></figure><p>Back to Amazon…….but this time let’s say all I have is $10,000 to invest in Amazon but I really want a $20,000 position. I might use the $10,000 and start trading <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/baseline-strategy-for-trading-spy-put-credit-spreads">put credit spreads</a> on the SPY. I might continue to trade put credit spreads until I have $20,000 in total. Now I can go buy $20,000 on Amazon. As long as the duration of time it took me to get $20,000 was not too long (say a year) I would consider my basis in Amazon to be $10,000, not $20,000. In a way, I am buying Amazon at a 50% discount (a discount value investors would salivate for). At that discount, I don't really care what the price of Amazon stock is. I just care that I still think Amazon is a great company and will grow for years to come.</p>
<h2>The Best Way To Get Rich Is To Lower Basis</h2>
<p>Yes, I am the first to admit there are tons of flaws in the examples I listed above. There is an additional risk as well. But I would also submit there is the opportunity cost of sitting on the sidelines with cash waiting for a discount in the market that may or may not come. I would also point out I have an entire portfolio strategy. In the case of the leaps, or put credit spreads there is a chance I could lose a fair amount of money and get into Amazon after losing some of the money effectively increasing my basis. My overall portfolio strategy assumes some of these trades will not work and losses are built into the plan. As a whole my play to lower basis before entering any buy and hold strategy tends to work. <br /><br />The lesson I am trying to convey here is when I put on my long-term investing hat the number one thing I am concerned with is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLMQ6x4qkTM">reducing basis</a>. I truly think it is the best way for retail investors to get ahead. Waiting for a discount in a stock or using margin to buy more stock are strategies for slower overall portfolio growth.<br /><br />If I was a rap artist I most certainly would have a single called “Reduce Reduce Reduce Your Basis” :).</p>

      ><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/related-topics/short-strangles">short strangle</a> option strategy is an opportunity to profit when a stock moves sideways. Instead of just selling one call or one put, you sell one of each, which produces twice the income.

                      <p>A <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/related-topics/short-strangles">short strangle</a> play is a good opportunity to earn some option premiums if you expect the underlying stock to remain in a narrow trading band until the contracts expire. The maximum gain is limited to just these <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option-premium.asp">premiums</a>. If you pay <a href="https://options.cafe/options-broker-finder">commissions</a>, the greatest profit is even lower. If you guess wrong, and the stock makes a significant move to either the upside or downside, you could experience a substantial loss.</p>
<h2>Opening a Short Strangle Position</h2>
<p>The short strangle is created by selling one <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-call-option">call option</a> and one <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-option">put option</a>, both with the same underlying stock and expiration date. The call contract has a higher strike price than the put, which makes the strangle different than the straddle play. Both contracts in the strangle strategy are out-of-the-money. </p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/risk-graphs/_width1000/short-strangles-risk-graph.png?mtime=20180514205721" alt="" /></figure><h2>Example of a Short Strangle</h2>
<p>Suppose you think <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/JNJ?p=JNJ">Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)</a> will move sideways for the next few months. The company doesn’t appear to have any new technologies in the pipeline, nor will it release any earnings. You also don’t expect any major news announcements. If JNJ doesn’t make any major revelations, the stock price is likely to remain fairly calm. </p>
<p>With a current stock price of $132, you sell a call option for $1 per share. The contract is worth 100 shares and has a strike price of $134. The total premium received is $100. At the same time, you sell a put option that is also out-of-the money. It has a strike price of $130 and is valid for 100 shares. You’re able to receive $1.50 per share, for a total of $150. The grand total for both contracts is $250. Remember that this income will be reduced by any trading fees your broker charges you.</p>
<h2>Equations for the Short Strangle</h2>
<p>Looking at the numbers in our example reveals the following breakeven prices:</p>
<blockquote>Upper limit = call strike + call premium per share + put premium per share – commission per share</blockquote>
<blockquote>Lower limit = put strike – call premium per share – put premium per share + commission per share</blockquote>
<p>In the Johnson &amp; Johnson example, the upper limit is $136.50 ($134 + $2.50). The lower limit is $127.50 ($130 - $2.50). These figures assume no commissions are paid to the broker-dealer. </p>
<h2>Short Strangle Hazards</h2>
<p>As long as JNJ experiences no significant volatility and stays within that trading band, between $127.50 and $136.50, the derivative investment will be profitable. If the stock moves outside this rather narrow band, the trade will begin to lose money. </p>
<p>Remember that any option contract that is in-the-money by a penny or more at expiration will be automatically exercised. Contracts can also be exercised early. This could force you to buy shares of JNJ from a holder of a put contract (at an inflated price), or sell shares (at a below market price) to a holder of a call contract. If you don’t already have the shares in your brokerage account, you would have to buy them at market price. </p>
<p>If JNJ went to $140, the put option would be worthless and the call would be worth $6 per share, for a total of $600. You received $250 in premiums, so the total loss on the trade would be $350. Because the loss is calculated by subtracting the call strike price from the stock price, there is in theory no maximum to the loss if the equity goes up.</p>
<p>If it were discovered that one of the company’s products causes a health problem, and the stock goes down to $120, the call option would have no value, while the put contract would be worth $10 per share, for a total amount of $1,000. Subtracting the amount made in premiums, the loss would be $750. Because the stock can’t go lower than $0, the loss on the downside is limited. </p>

                      <p>As you can see from my trades in the table below April 2018 was a losing month. This is a great example of when things go bad -- and they always do. Honestly, this was not even a bad month compared to other bad months. Based on an average net credit of $0.23 it will take 5 winning SPY <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">Put Credit Spread Trades</a> to get back the losses from this month.</p>

                      <p>My rule of thumb is to always close trades at the end of day if the current SPY stock price is below the short strike of my SPY Put Credit Spread. </p>
<p>While it might be painful it is much better to lose a small amount of money than lose 100% of the money. One of my trades got completely away from me (the 100% loss) -- while one of my trades was only a 30% loss as I was able to close it before it got too far past the short strike of my Put Credit Spread.</p>
<p>This month was an opportunity to remember to be humble in this trading strategy. As a reminder it is important to always be prepared for down months.<br /></p>

                      <p>If February 2018 was your first month trading <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">Put Credit Spreads</a> on the SPY you might not think this is a great strategy. However there is another way of looking at this. I have not had a loss in nearly 18 months. Over the last 18 months my returns have been rather outsized compared to other investment opportunities. From time to time you have to take some losses but if you have a stock pile of wins in your account you tend to still outperform (by a lot) any other traditional investments. </p>

                      <p>Thanks to the Trump tax cuts the market in January 2018 was pretty stable. Just creeping up in value each day. With volatility so low there were not many opportunities for SPY <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">Put Credit Spread Trades</a>. While I opened a few trades none closed.

                      <p>American corporations release their earnings reports every 3 months. The data gives investors an idea of how well the companies are doing financially. If an earnings announcement contains any information traders weren’t expecting, the stock price could plummet or skyrocket, depending on whether the release is negative or positive. On the other hand, if an earnings report is in line with market expectations, the stock price will probably be little affected.</p>
<h2>Finding a Way to Profit from Earnings Announcements</h2>
<p>Knowing that earnings surprises usually produce significant price movements, either to the upside or downside, it would be nice to have an investment strategy that could profit from a major price movement. You could buy the stock ahead of the earnings announcement; but if the release is negative, you’re going to be on the wrong side of the trade. If you shorted the stock, you could also end up on the losing side. </p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/112189-OOJKDC-296.jpg?mtime=20180118172932" alt="" /></figure><p>Enter the world of options, where it’s possible to profit in either direction. There are two types of derivative strategies that can be successful regardless of whether a stock moves up or down, as long as the stock moves a sufficient amount. These are the strangle and straddle plays.<br /></p>
<h2>Using Straddles and Strangles</h2>
<p>With both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangle_(options)">strangles</a> and <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/how-to-profit-using-long-straddles">straddles</a>, you buy one call option and one put option. The two contracts have the same underlying equity and expiration date. For the straddle, the strike prices are the same. For the strangle, the call option has a higher strike than the put, and both contracts are out-of-the-money. </p>
<h2>Straddles v. Strangles</h2>
<p>Because both contracts of a strangle position are out-of-the-money, the investment is usually a little cheaper than the straddle. However, the break-even points of the strangle are further apart than a straddle. The strangle also has a greater chance of resulting in a complete loss than a comparable straddle. Time decay is a greater risk for strangles, which means they will deteriorate in price more quickly over a given time period. </p>
<h2>Timing is Key</h2>
<p>Like other investments, buying at the appropriate time is crucial in either a straddle or strangle play. Entering the trade a few days before an earnings announcement is not recommended, because at this time the cost of the option premiums will be too high. Implied volatility also tends to be higher right before an earnings release. </p>
<p>A good time to enter a long straddle or strangle position is two to six weeks before a company is set to release its quarterly earnings data. If you try to buy a week before the announcement or earlier, you’ll probably see higher prices for the contracts. </p>
<h2>Choosing the Correct Strike Price</h2>
<p>You want a strike price that is near-the-money. This will keep the cost of the trade to a bare minimum, while maintaining the unlimited potential gain. For example, if the cost of a stock is $79, you would buy a straddle with a strike price of $80. If you wanted to try a strangle instead, you would buy a put option with a strike price of $75, and a call option with a strike price of $80. </p>
<h2>Getting the Right Expiration Date</h2>
<p>Time decay erodes a contract’s value, especially during the last month of its life; so you want to avoid options that are set to expire in under 30 days. You also want to allow at least two to three weeks for an earnings announcement to affect a stock’s price. If you buy a month before the earnings announcement, and you want half a month of time after the release for the stock price to move, and you want to avoid the last month of a contract’s life, you should purchase options that have at least 2½ months of life in them. </p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Suppose you were expecting an earnings surprise from Dillard’s, Inc. in its next quarterly release. The stock trades on the Big Board under the ticker symbol DDS. The share price has been hovering around $73 for a few weeks. The company is set to announce its earnings data soon. What should you do?</p>
<p>For the straddle, you would buy one call and one put, each with a strike price of $73, if the contracts exist. If they don’t, you could buy contracts with strikes of $75. For the strangle play, a call with a strike price of $75 and a put with a $70 strike would work. The cost of either trade is the maximum loss you can suffer. You can’t lose more than premiums plus commissions on either a long straddle or long strangle. </p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/long-straddle-risk-graph.jpg?mtime=20180118170719" alt="" /></figure><p><br /></p>
<p>Suppose you buy a Dillard’s straddle three weeks before the earnings release. You purchase one call option for $4 per share and one put contract for $3 per share. The strike price is $72.50, and both contracts are for 100 shares each. The total cost of the trade is $700. Assuming no commission paid, that’s the most you can lose. </p>
<p>You could have bought the stock instead, hoping for a positive release. If you had done so, you would have guessed very wrong. Analysts were expecting 21¢ per share of earnings, but on August 10, 2017, the company reported a loss of 58¢ per share. By the end of the trading day, investors had sent the stock down to $61, a loss of 16%. </p>
<p>In just one day, the call contract you bought is worthless, but the put has a value of $1,150. Subtracting the $700 you paid in premiums, it’s a one-day profit of $450. </p>
<p>And yes, you could have shorted the stock. But that would entail an unlimited amount of risk on the upside and a limited gain on the downside. The straddle, on the other hand, had a maximum risk of $700 with unlimited return potential.</p>

                      <p>This month is a good example of why you never second guess your strategy. You will notice I put on 2 spreads a day apart with nearly the same strikes prices and the same expiration. Some might see this as too much risk. My strategy is based on the fact that around 11% of my trades will loss money. I never know which 11% so I just place trades if there are trades to be had. Never second guess. Build a strategy, backtest it, monitor it, and only make lasting changes to your strategy (no one off, second guessing, changes). </p>

      ><![CDATA[<p>Tradier is a powerful brokerage API that allows non-brokers to provide broker services. Let’s talk about why Options Cafe selected Tradier as our first official partner. </p>]]></summary>
                <description
      ><![CDATA[
                    
                      <figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/tradier-brokerage-logo.png?mtime=20171108192021" alt="Tradier Broker -- Works With Options Cafe" title="Tradier Broker -- Works With Options Cafe" /></figure><p>Have you heard of the brokerage API "<a href="https://brokerage.tradier.com/?utm_campaign=options.cafe">Tradier</a>"? It’s a powerful software/toolset that is literally reshaping the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/younginvestors/06/firstbroker.asp">investment brokerage</a> field. Tradier is making it possible for option traders to use powerful, specialized option software, such as <a href="https://options.cafe/">Options Cafe</a>, and to integrate it directly into trading. Beyond options, Tradier is revolutionizing trading with other assets, such as stocks.<br /></p>
<p>Here’s how the old way worked: You picked a broker, you used that broker, and you used their tools. Sometimes, you could buy upgraded premium services. Other times, you could buy external software/tools and use it separately from your broker. This software, however, could not be integrated with your broker or your trading. As a result, it was difficult to access a complete toolset, and to have up-to-date and in-sync data. This was true for options investors, stock traders, and everyone else.</p>
<h2>Tradier and the Broker API Revolution</h2>
<p>For options investors, this was a big hurdle because many brokerages simply don’t offer good options trading tools. Specialized software and tools can go a long way towards increasing your <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profitmargin.asp">profit margin</a> and increasing the likelihood of producing a profit. However, options traders now have more options (pun intended) when it comes to software and tools, and companies like Tradier are a big reason why. Now, you can pick your broker and your tools separately.</p>
<p>So what is Tradier? The company has been called a “<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/042915/tradier-brokerage-api-steroids.asp">brokerage API on steroids</a>” by Investopedia, and that’s a pretty accurate description. First, API stands for Application Program Interface. An API is a set of tools, routines, and protocols for building software. Basically, an API provides the “building blocks” needed to build software. In layman’s terms, an API allows users to connect directly with a provider’s data and software, and to even use it to build their own unique software. API’s usually work through the cloud, meaning you can access the data and software online, and in some cases can even use their servers to carry out various processes.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/options-trading-on-steriods.png?mtime=20171108194308" alt="Options Trading On Steroids" title="Options Trading On Steroids" /></figure><p>So let’s circle back to Tradier, a brokerage API. This means you can use Tradier’s data and software to build brokerage and trading software. Tradier does this by working with data directly from markets. While Option Cafe focuses on options, Tradier aggregates data regarding a wide range of investment vehicles, including equities, ETFs, mutual funds, stocks, and of course, options.</p>
<h2>What Does a Broker API Actually Do?</h2>
<p>Importantly, Tradier enables trading. A software developer can build trading functionality into their software or even website. In some cases, blogs and other information websites have been using Tradier to offer trading services directly to their audience. Essentially, Tradier creates a “white box” brokerage service, through which software developers can use the Tradier API to create their own brokerage services. Instead of having to reinvent the wheel and reinvent brokerage capacities, software developers can use the tools provided by Tradier.</p>
<p>Tradier is <a href="https://brokercheck.finra.org/firm/summary/104982">FINRA</a> licensed and working with more than 30 clients. This means the company is legitimate and regulated. When Options Cafe launches later this year, we’ll be another one of Tradier’s clients.</p>
<p>Tradier charges fees, of course. They have to pay their staff, and maintain and refine their software. However, the commissions are quite affordable. Since Tradier can conduct trades, it can act as an investment broker, enabling options investors and others to trade. However, their API-driven model allows them to dramatically reduce costs. That means they can pass on savings directly to their customers.</p>
<h2>Options With the Tradier Brokerage API</h2>
<p>For options, Tradier charges only 35 cents per contract (plus a $3.95 ticket charge). Compare that to eTrade, which charges a 75 cent fee (with a bigger ticket charge). This means that Tradier charges less than half of what eTrade does.</p>
<p>Crazy right? Who doesn’t want to save on trades? One of the biggest challenges with trading options is keeping fees and commissions low. This is especially true for people who want to invest smaller amounts, or execute a high number of options trades. Some platforms, like eTrade, offer discounts for active options traders, but these commissions rarely approach Tradier’s flat rate.</p>
<p>However, there are always tradeoffs. With Tradier by itself, you won’t be able to access as much expert advice, advanced trading tools, data, and all the rest. Tradier does offer some tools -- in fact their web application is pretty delightful to use for basic interactions. </p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/tradier-options-trading.png?mtime=20171108192358" alt="Options Trading With Tradier" title="Options Trading With Tradier" /><figcaption>Tradier Web Application</figcaption></figure><p>This is where Options Cafe comes in. Our platform will be able to plug directly into Tradier, meaning you can use their brokerage services to conduct trades while using Options Cafe to engage. Options Cafe will be able to provide you with tons of advances options trading tools. We built Options Cafe precisely because we realized there was a gap in options software services. Perhaps more so than any other type of investment, options trading can benefit tremendously from powerful, data-informed tools. And that’s what Options Cafe provides.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/reports-with-options-cafe.png?mtime=20171108192733" alt="Reports With Options Cafe" title="Reports With Options Cafe" /><figcaption>Options Cafe Reports</figcaption></figure><h2>Options Cafe Plus Tradier</h2>
<p>The end result of Tradier + Options Cafe is a powerful option trading platform that costs less than most other <a href="https://options.cafe/options-broker-finder?strategy=vertical-spread&amp;lots=10">brokers</a>. By using the Tradier API, we can keep costs manageable. By building software that has been designed by options traders and for options traders, we can deliver the most powerful options software possible. It’s a win-win.</p>
<p>With Options Cafe, we make it easy to implement advanced options trades, such as an <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/iron-condor-explained">Iron Condor</a>. Combined with Tradier, it’s not only easy but affordable to set up such trades. In the past, setting up advanced options trading strategies was often a headache in and of itself. With multi-leg option strategies, you also have to execute several trades at once. This meant that fees quickly ate into your profit potential. Tradier’s low fees, however, will help alleviate that pain point.  </p>

      ><![CDATA[<p>Instead of trading stocks or other securities, why not trade time?

                <description
      ><![CDATA[
                    
                      <p>If you expect a stock to remain in a neutral trading range for a few months, maybe because it isn’t set to release earnings or doesn’t have a history of volatility, then you might be able to earn a nice profit while stockholders earn little to nothing. With a unique <a href="https://www.optionsplaybook.com/option-strategies">option strategy</a>, you can sell time, which is why the investment tactic is known as the long calendar spread.<br /></p>
<h2>Taking a Long Calendar Spread Position</h2>
<p>The long calendar option spread can be entered by purchasing one contract and simultaneously selling another contract with a shorter expiration date. Typically, the contract you write should expire one week to one month prior to the expiration of the contract you purchase. Both contracts have the same underlying security and strike price, and the contracts should be at-the-money or just out-of-the-money. The options can be either puts or calls, but not a mix. </p>
<h2>Profiting from the Long Calendar Strategy</h2>
<p>Notice that in the long calendar spread, you take a short position on the contract that has the shorter expiration date. The time value of this contract should deteriorate more quickly than the time value of the contract with the longer expiration date. As the first expiration date approaches, the difference between the two contract values should widen, assuming the stock price has not made any significant moves, either to the upside or downside. </p>
<h2>Bulls, Bears, and Risks</h2>
<p>The primary risk with the long calendar spread is that the stock moves in the wrong direction, which will cause the contract you sold to have intrinsic value, leading to an exercise. If that happens, you will be left only with the contract you purchased, which will also have intrinsic value. You could either sell it on the open market, which would close out your derivative investment; or you could exercise it. </p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/long-calendar-spread-graph.jpeg?mtime=20171029133317" alt="" /></figure><p>If you used a <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-option">put</a> spread, the long contract you hold will develop intrinsic value if the underlying stock turns south. Thus, you can have a bearish view on the underlying equity when using puts in the time spread. If you used <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-call-option">calls</a>, the contract you hold will increase in value if the stock heads north; so you can be bullish in your long-term expectations.<br /></p>
<h2>Example of a Long Calendar Spread</h2>
<p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KMB/">Kimberly-Clark (KMB)</a> reported earnings last week while trading at $122. The data was in line with market expectations. You don’t foresee any major changes in the stock’s price, other than a gradual rise over time. You decide that a calendar spread with calls would be a safe method of earning some extra income. </p>
<p>You sell one call contract out-of-the-money for $350 with an October expiration date. At the same time, you buy another call contract, with the same strike price of $125, for $450. It expires in November. The total cost of the investment is $100. This net debit is the maximum loss the investment can produce. </p>
<p>If KMB hovers around $122, the short contract will be worthless at expiration. The long contract will decrease in value, but will still have some time value left in it. At this point you can sell the contract. If it has a market price of $300, the net profit on the investment will be $200 ($300 - $100). </p>
<p>If KMB increases to $130, the short contract will be exercised, but the contract you purchased will also rise in intrinsic value at the same time. If the stock declines to $105 at expiration, both contracts will have zero value, and the investment will be over, with the maximum loss of just $100.</p>

      ><![CDATA[<p>Many stock traders are jumping into options trading. Options offer a fantastic way to diversify and to produce extraordinary returns. Let’s look at the key differences between options and stocks, and why so many stock traders are becoming options traders.</p>]]></summary>
                <description
      ><![CDATA[
                    
                      <figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width1000/jumping-from-stock-investing-to-options-trading.jpg?mtime=20171017191945" alt="Stock Trader To Options Trader" title="Stock Trader To Options Trader" /></figure><p>Many options traders first cut their investing teeth with stock trading. In some cases, these investors have enjoyed a lot of success with stocks but want to branch out. In other cases, they have been trying to make a living off of day trading with stocks but it isn’t working out. No matter the motive, options trading is a great choice for many investors.<br /></p>
<p>By trading options you can use new strategies to produce profits with different methods and during different market conditions. For example, with an <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/iron-condor-explained">iron condor</a> you can make money off of horizontal price movements.</p>
<p>Options trading opens up a whole new world of potential. That probably sounds a bit high-minded but it’s true. Options can be used with a wide range of investment strategies. Many stock investors start buying options as a form of insurance for stocks they own. Other investors use options to gain <a href="https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/shows/from-theory-to-practice/episodes/option-alpha-06-22-2016">alpha</a>. In other words they want to produce a bit of extra profit.</p>
<p>Still, many investors turn to options trading after they find that <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/how-successful-options-traders-generate-monthly-income">day trading isn’t working out</a>. It’s difficult to make a living off of day trading unless you are willing to expose yourself to a considerable amount of risk. You’ll either have to invest huge sums of money, or you’ll have to invest in risky penny stocks.</p>
<p>Options can offer a higher potential to produce profit while also lowering your exposure to risks.</p>
<h2>Why Options Trading Beats Out Day Trading &amp; Penny Stocks</h2>
<p>Many stock investors who move into options trading are coming from either day trading or <a href="https://www.timothysykes.com/">penny stock trading</a>. Day traders attempt to make money off of temporary inefficiencies in the market. </p>
<p>Penny traders try to make money off of trading in higher risk, low-cost stocks. Penny stocks sell for $5 or less per share. Often, these stocks are for struggling companies that are at risk of going bankrupt or are facing major legal cases, etc.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width1000/stock-exchange-913964_1280.jpg?mtime=20171017192319" alt="Hard To Profit From Day Trading" title="Hard To Profit From Day Trading" /></figure><p>Day trading can involve a variety of different risks. Usually, day traders care more about volatility and price movements, rather than the fundamental underlying qualities of an asset. Many options trading strategies also focus on price movements rather than underlying fundamental values.<br /></p>
<h2>Probably-Based Options Trading</h2>
<p>I tend to promote “probably-based options trading.” Basically, my primary method focuses around calculating the <a href="https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/learn/probability-of-profit">probability of profit</a>, or POP as it’s sometimes called. </p>
<p>There are a lot of tools that you can use to determine the probability of profit (soon <a href="https://options.cafe/">Options Cafe</a> will help with this). There are also a variety of trading strategies, such as the Iron Condor, that you can use to increase the probability of producing a profit.</p>
<p>Probably-based trading can produce high returns, especially when compared to stocks. With probability-based options trading, you often sacrifice some profit potential in exchange for lowering risks and increasing the likelihood of producing a profit. </p>
<p>High-profit, low-risk investments are rare, and usually the result of aberrations in the market. However, probably-based options trading allows you to consistently produce considerable profits. Over time, these profits can add up to a tremendous amount.</p>
<h2>Options Offer A Lot More Bang For the Buck</h2>
<p>Stocks are expensive. Options allow you much better leverage. This means you can turn a small amount of money into a lot of money.</p>
<p>Let’s say you are very confident that Acme Computers is going to launch a revolutionary new virtual reality technology. The VR tech is scheduled to be unveiled at the beginning of next month. You believe that this technology is going to be a big hit. It could the next iPhone or iPod. </p>
<p>Problem is, Acme Inc. stocks are selling for $100 dollars a pop and you only have $1,000 dollars to invest. You know Acme stocks are going to climb. You believe they could even hit $120 in the days that follow the VR tech release. </p>
<p>Yet you can only buy ten shares. Even if stocks reach $120, you would make only $200 bucks in profit. While that return is substantial, you know there is a lot more money to be made.<br /></p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/entrepreneur-696971_1280.jpg?mtime=20171017192524" alt="Make Money Trading Options From Home" title="Make Money Trading Options From Home" /></figure><p>One option is to buy options for Acme stock. Let’s say you buy Acme stock options due to expire on the third Friday of the same month that the VR tech will be unveiled. Let’s assume that options to buy Acme stock ($100 per stock) are selling for $5 per option. Numbers like this are commonly seen in options trading.<br /></p>
<p>Instead of buying 10 stocks, you buy 200 options. Your prediction turns out to be correct. Acme unveils its VR tech, and stock prices climb to $120 dollars in the days that follow. Now you can exercise your option contract, gaining a $20 dollar profit for each contract. That adds up to $4,000 dollars! This is certainly a lot more than $200.</p>
<h2>Using Options As Stock Insurance</h2>
<p>Another common reason for stock traders to start trading options is to use as a form of insurance.<br /></p>
<p>Let’s continue with the Acme Computers VR technology example. The unveiling has already been planned. This time, let’s assume that markets are very excited about the potential technology. As such, stock prices have been slowly gaining, and have reached $100. </p>
<p>You, on the other hand, are not so excited. Let’s assume that you are a virtual reality expert. You’ve been following the technology for years. So far, everything you’ve heard about Acme’s virtual reality technology suggests that it isn’t all that revolutionary. </p>
<p>You believe that markets may be over-pricing ACME stock at the moment. Once markets come to the same conclusion, they could swing dramatically. Let’s assume that you own 1,000 stocks, or $100,000 dollars worth of stocks. </p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width1000/crash-test-1620595_1280.jpg?mtime=20171017192730" alt="Trading Options As An Insurance Policy" title="Trading Options As An Insurance Policy" /></figure><p>This represents a big chunk of your retirement portfolio. You have a lot of confidence in Acme and love their fundamentals. However, you’re worried about the VR tech unveiling and a potential price correction. You don’t want to sell your Acme stocks, but you don’t want to be exposed to any risks either.</p>
<p>So what should you do? Again, options are the answer. You can buy put options, which will allow you to sell your options at a predetermined price. So, you buy 1,000 put options granting you the right to sell Acme stocks at $100 in three weeks time. Let’s assume you pay $3 dollars per option. Again, this number is theoretical but realistic.</p>
<p>So you pay $3,000 for the option, or right, to sell your 1,000 shares at $100 dollars. Your dire prediction comes true. Acme unveils its VR tech. It’s a dud. Questions over leadership start swirling. Stock prices plummet. </p>
<p>Suddenly Acme shares are trading for only $75! You’ve lost $25,000 out of your retirement portfolio! But wait, you have your options! You sell your Acme shares for $100 instead. Instead of losing $25,000 like many other traders, you’ve lost only $3,000.</p>
<h2>Other Reasons Stock Traders Love Options</h2>
<p>Let’s go over some other reasons stock investors trade options. Turns out that there  are plenty of reasons. For example, with stocks you make money off of price movements. If you buy stocks, you want prices to go up. If you short-sell, you want prices to go down. </p>
<p>With options, you can set up an iron condor for example. If you do, you want prices to remain stable, or within the trading range set up in your iron condor. If this happens, you will make money! There are only a few ways to generate substantial returns off of flat markets. An iron condor is one such way.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width1000/candy-1678933_1280.jpg?mtime=20171017193004" alt="Traders Love Options" title="Traders Love Options" /></figure><p>Speaking of short-selling, put options offer another way to make money off of dropping prices. Except, put options are far less risky than short selling. When you short sell a stock, you expose yourself to unlimited risk. No matter how high stock prices rise, you will have to buy those stocks.<br /></p>
<p>With a put option you automatically know how much you can lose. When you buy put options the maximum loss will correspond with how much you paid for the options. In fact, the upfront risks of buying options are one of the chief reasons many stock investors start investing in options.</p>
<p>Further, there are now a ton of tools that you can use to analyze potential options trades. The nature of options means you can often plot out risks and scenarios with these tools. When you use these tools properly, you can greatly increase your probability of producing a profit.</p>
<h2>Let’s Conclude With a Brief Stock to Options Trader Story</h2>
<p>As you can see, there are many reasons why stock traders should consider trading options. This article is far from exhaustive. I’ve met so many stock traders over the years who started trading options and fell in love. Many have their own unique story.</p>
<p>In fact, I’d like to end with the story of a friend of mine. He’s quite well off, to be frank. I had been urging him to try options trading for quite some time. He recognized the advantages, but also didn’t want to leave his comfort zone. </p>
<p>With his investing returns stalling out, however, he decided to give options a go. He started with a small amount. I provided quite a bit of tutoring. Options made up only a small portion of his overall investment portfolio. However, he quickly found that he was making more money off options than his much larger stock portfolio.</p>
<p>He’s still trading options to this day. I’ll be honest, I get at least some of the credit for his success. I won’t say that I taught him “everything” he knows about options, but I taught him a lot. Fortunately, you can keep reading our blog here at <a href="https://options.cafe/blog">Options Cafe</a> and I’ll fill you in!</p>

                      <figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/calendar-spread-image.jpg?mtime=20171012181705" alt="Options Calendar Spread" title="Options Calendar Spread" /></figure><p>If a stock is soon to make a major move, either to the upside or downside, a <a href="http://www.optionstrading.org/strategies/volatile-market/short-calendar-call-spread/">short calendar spread</a> is one method to profit from the price change. The derivative strategy has limited profitability, which is capped at the net credit earned, less commissions. The potential loss in theory is unlimited when using calls and considerable when using puts.<br /></p>
<h2>Making a Short Calendar Investment</h2>
<p>The short calendar spread can be used either with calls or puts, but not a mix of them. With this strategy, you buy one contract while simultaneously selling another. Both options have the same underlying stock and strike price, and they should both be at-the-money. The written contract has a longer expiration date, by a week, a few weeks, or a month. Because the contracts have different expiration dates, the strategy is called the calendar or time spread. </p>
<p>With a larger amount of time value, the written contract is more expensive. Thus, entering the short calendar should produce a net credit. </p>
<h2>Short Calendar Example</h2>
<p>Suppose you hear in the news that <a href="http://quotes.wsj.com/BIIB">Biogen</a>, a major player in the biotech industry, will be releasing the results of a study on an experimental drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. If the results are favorable, you expect the stock to experience a major upswing, but if the results are a disappointment, the stock price will probably see a drop. </p>
<p>You want to be able to profit regardless of which direction the stock heads. Knowing that the short calendar play will earn money in either direction, as long as the stock does make a move, you decide to take a short calendar position. </p>
<p>Biogen is currently priced at $286 in the open market. You decide to trade put options. You sell one put contract with a strike price of $285 and simultaneously buy a put option with the same strike price. The written contract expires one week after the purchased contract. It sells for $700, while the purchased contract has a $500 price tag. Thus, the net credit for the option play is $200.</p>
<p>The results of the study are released, and there is no difference between the drug and a placebo. The stock price drops quickly to $250 and hovers there. Because both contracts are put options, they both increase in value; and since they both have the same strike price, they will experience similar increases. </p>
<p>You decide to sell the contract you hold and realize a profit. You receive $3,800. The short contract is still live, and you receive an exercise. This forces you to buy 100 shares of Biogen for $28,500, which you immediately sell for $25,000. This produces a loss of $3,500 on the short contract. Subtracting the loss from the $3,800 gain on the long contract produces a profit of $300 on the long contract. Adding this to the net credit you received at the outset produces a total gain of $500.</p>
<h2>Gains and Losses</h2>
<p>The short calendar strategy with puts becomes risky whenever the stock price declines, the long contract expires, and then the stock price goes down even more. This situation will increase the intrinsic value of the short contract. If you’re concerned about this issue, you can mitigate this type of risk by keeping the gap in expiration dates to a week, rather than a month. This gives the stock less time to decrease after the first contract expires. </p>
<p>Using the spread with call options could result in a similar situation if the stock increases in value, the first contract expires, and the price continues upward. This situation would increase the value of the second contract, outweighing whatever you made on the first contract at expiration. </p>

                <description
      ><![CDATA[
                    
                      <p>Let’s go over the <a href="https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/learn/butterfly-spread">options butterfly spread</a>, a popular advanced trading strategy used by many options traders. It uses four options contracts with the same expiration date. The butterfly allows traders to produce profits off of stable prices, and is generally a low risk but also low profit potential strategy. Let’s dig into why that’s the case, and what it means.</p>
<p>A butterfly spread is a neutral options trading strategy. What does that mean? It means that you want asset prices to stay neutral, and that you don’t want prices to swing far either way. Simpler trading strategies often rely on a price swing in one direction, meaning an asset will either gain or lose value. </p>
<p>With a butterfly strategy you use four options contracts with the same expiration date but with three different strike prices. These contracts are used to create a range of prices at which you can produce a profit. The four option strategies you buy will either be all calls, or all puts. The two options in the middle can either be bought or sold. The high and low priced options are always the opposite of the middle contracts. So if you buy the middle contracts, you will sell the outer ones.</p>
<p>We’ll dig into the mechanics of the butterfly strategy later in this article. If you want to learn more now, click here.</p>

<h2>The Risk &amp; Reward of Butterfly Options Trading</h2>
<p>Before digging into how you can produce profits off of butterfly trading, let’s first discuss the risks. When investing, it is important to know what you’re getting yourself “into.” Different options trading strategies will have vastly different risk and reward profiles. So let’s go over the risk and reward profile of the butterfly trading strategy. </p>
<p>In terms of risk profile, butterfly spreads are generally low risk. This also means that the profit potential is also restrained. Generally, higher profit potential correlates with higher risk, while lower risk correlates with lower profit potential. This is true not just of options trading and strategies, but investing as a whole. While profit potential is low with the butterfly trading strategy, the chance of actually producing a profit is high. </p>
<p>Butterfly trading strategies are similar to the “<a href="https://options.cafe/blog/iron-condor-explained">iron condor</a>” strategy in that they produce profits with horizontal price movements. Both the butterfly and the iron condor are useful for producing profits off of price stability. The two strategies are different, however. If you want to learn about iron condors as well, we suggest checking out our Iron Condor article <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/iron-condor-explained">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Understanding Vertical Spreads In Options Trading</h2>
<p>Before we dig into butterfly strategies, it’s important to understand what <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">vertical spreads</a> are. A butterfly strategy will use both a bear spread and a bull spread, with each of these being vertical spreads. So what is a vertical spread?</p>
<p>With a vertical spread, you buy one option with a lower strike price and sell them, and then purchase options with a higher strike price. In other words, you buy and sell two options of the same type at the same time, with the exact same expiration date, but they have different strike prices. Vertical spreads can be created with either all calls, or all puts. They can also be bullish or bearish. A butterfly strategy is both bearish and bullish, but we’ll dig into that later.<br /></p>
<h2>How a Butterfly Spread Works</h2>
<p>We’ve already outlined the basics of the butterfly options trading strategy. Can you recall them? First, the butterfly will use four different options. All four options with have the same expiration date. One option will be set at a higher strike price, another option will be set at a lower strike price. Two of the options will be placed in the dead center, meaning the difference between the upper bound option and the lower bound will be the exact same. </p>
<p>It’s important to note that there are two types of butterfly spreads. The following example will be a long butterfly spread and will create a net debit. A short butterfly spread will create a net credit. We will outline the difference between the two in the next section. </p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/long-call-butterfly-risk-graph_170910_185710.jpg?mtime=20170910115710" alt="" /></figure><p>Let’s assume you want to execute a butterfly strategy for ACME Computers, which is currently selling for $100 dollars a share. You believe prices will hold steady over the next month so you execute a long butterfly trade. As such, you sell two call options with an expiration date in one month and with a strike price of $100 dollars. Now, it’s time to buy two call options, one at a higher price, and one at a lower price. So, you buy one call option at $110 and buy another at $90. Notice that they are the exact same distance from the middle options you sold.<br /></p>
<p>Let’s assume that the ACME $90 call option sold for $10 dollars, and the one ACME $110 option sold for $7 dollars, and that the two $100 call options that you sold netted you $6 dollars a piece. Remember, when you write a trade, the money is credited to you, meaning you get money but have to cover the options. You will notice, however, that the overall trade in this case is a net debit of $5 dollars. Since options are sold in batches of 100, you multiply 5 X 100 to determine your maximum loss, which in this case is $500 dollars (+ commissions &amp; fees with your broker). </p>
<p>In this case, the butterfly strategy basically creates two trades at once. There is a long $90 dollar trade and a short $100 dollar trade. This is the first trade. The second trade is a short $110 call and a long $100 dollar call. With a butterfly spread, your profit is maximized the closer the ACME stocks are to $100 dollars (the middle) upon expiration. Let’s assume your instincts are proven 100% correct, and Acme is at exactly $100 dollars upon expiration. </p>
<p>If this were to happen, the ACME $90 call would expire in the money with an intrinsic value of $10 dollars. The ACME $100 dollar calls would expire worthless, meaning you get to pocket the credit you received, which was $12 dollars. The ACME $110 options would also expire out of the money and would be worthless, meaning you’d lose all of the money you invested in them ($7 dollars per share). Remember, the above numbers are multiplied by 100 because options are sold in batches of 100.</p>
<p>If Acme’s stock prices rise or drop, but stay close to $100, you will still produce a profit, but it’ll be reduced. </p>
<h2>Long vs Short and Call Versus Put Butterfly Spreads</h2>
<p>A butterfly spread basically “revolves” around the two center options. These two options will determine the overall nature of your butterfly strategy, and whether it is a long or short option. The butterfly option example outlined above was a long call option. This means that you sold the two middle options, collecting a credit. The upper and lower options, however, were bought, requiring you to pay for them. Generally, this will create a net debit. A long put option is basically the opposite. You buy the two middle options, and sell the two outer options. This will generally create a net credit. </p>
<p>There are also long put butterfly spreads, and short put butterfly spreads. With a long put butterfly spread you buy one put at a higher strike price, sell the two at-the-money puts in the middle, and then buy one put at the lower price.  The short put butterfly spread is the opposite. You sell (or write) one the higher strike price put option (meaning it’s out of the money). Then you buy the two middle in-the-money options, and sell another out-of-the-money option with a higher strike price. </p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/short-put-butterfly-risk-graph.jpg?mtime=20170920191337" alt="" /></figure><p>All the various choices for your butterfly options trading strategy can get confusing. Don’t worry yourself if you don’t understand everything just yet. As with many investment strategies, it will start to make more sense as you work with the trades themselves.<br /></p>
<h2>Conclusion: When and Why to Use the Butterfly Spread</h2>
<p>The butterfly spread is a great tool for relatively stable markets that are not suffering large price swings. If there is a lot of uncertainty and volatility in the market, the risks will increase while profits will remain limited. This means that butterfly spreads, like iron condors (LINK), are great when prices are moving sideways, and are either rising or declining at a slow, stable rate. </p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width400/options-trading-butterflies.jpg?mtime=20171009210543" alt="" /></figure><p>If there are serious concerns over a financial crisis, or economic downturn, you probably don’t want to use a butterfly. Likewise, if the government is considering a massive stimulus plan that could lead to generally rising asset prices, such as quantitative easing, again it’s best to avoid the butterfly.<br /></p>
<p>Still, when markets are relatively stable, butterfly options offer a great way to profit off of that stability while also limiting yourself to risks. Remember, the most you can lose is what you invest. This makes it easier for you to project your finances and to manage your overall portfolio and its risk composition.</p>

                      <p>Once again it is time for our monthly summary of trades I closed. Below are the <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">put credit spread </a>trades I closed in September 2017. My birthday month!!</p>
<p>Compared to <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/my-spy-put-credit-spread-trades-for-august-2017">August</a> a number of put credit spreads closed this month. <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/how-does-volatility-affect-option-prices">Volatility</a> continues to be very low. When volatility is low we have less opportunities to place trades. Low volatility has 2 downsides: it is hard to deploy all your planned capital (not enough trades to place), and the premium you receive from selling the put credit spread is lower than normal (less profit per trade). </p>
<p>The upside to low volatility is we tend to not have losses. Personally I like low volatility times as it allows me time to build capital up to be able to float through drawdown periods. At some point volatility will increase. When volatility increases too much too fast losses can happen. I use these times to pad the possible upcoming losses. </p>

      ><![CDATA[
                    
                      <p>Today I’m going to discuss how <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/volatility-trading-allows-options-traders-to-think-different">volatility</a> affects premium.  But, first, an explanation of the term is in order.  There are two types of volatility that an options trader needs to pay attention.  The first is <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/university/optionvolatility/volatility2.asp">historical volatility</a>.  The second is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implied_volatility">implied volatility</a>.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width800/premium-options-trading.png?mtime=20170928111105" alt="Premium In Options Trading" title="Premium In Options Trading" /></figure><p>Historical volatility is just as its name implies.  It is a representation of the underlying’s actual past price movement, both up and down.  Implied volatility is what the market expects it to be in the future.  Now, to better understand how volatility affects premium, let’s take a quick look at the difference between market value and theoretical value.  The easiest way to do this is to compare the different components that make up the two.<br /></p>
<h2>What Determines An Option’s Market Value Affects Prices</h2>
<p>This is going to sound trite, but there are only two things that determine an option’s market value.  They are supply and demand.  That’s it.  It’s a simple point, but it’s important.  The reason that it’s important is because supply and demand are influenced by what traders think.  And, what traders think is also a key component of what makes up an option’s theoretical value.</p>
<h2>What Determines An Option’s Theoretical Value</h2>
<p>Theoretical value is calculated using six variables.  Those variables are the strike price of the option, the market price of the underlying stock, the time remaining until the option expirations, the amount of any dividend the stock pays, interest rates, and implied volatility.  Of these, implied volatility is the most important.</p>
<h2>Why Volatility Is So Important Options Prices</h2>
<p>The reason that implied volatility is the most important variable in determining an option’s theoretical value is because it is the great unknown in the equation.  At any given point in time, the other five variables are easily attainable.  They’re either right there staring you in the face on your trading workstation’s quote monitor or are printed in the financial section of your daily newspaper.  Implied volatility is a little more esoteric.  It’s the market’s estimate of where the stock is likely to trade between now and expiration.  Now, think about this in terms of market psychology and the last time you had an option trade go really bad…or really well.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/business-163464_1280.jpg?mtime=20170928111831" alt="" /></figure><p>The market’s expectation for how volatile a stock is going to be in the future isn’t always right.  Sometimes the market guesses that the stock will be more volatile than it has been in the past.  Sometimes it guesses that it will be less volatile.<br /></p>
<p>When the market thinks that the stock will be more volatile in the future than it has been in the past, then it's implied volatility will be a bigger number than its historical volatility.  When traders think that the stock will be less volatile going forward than it has been, then it's implied volatility will be a smaller number than its historical volatility.  It’s this mismatch between historical volatility and implied volatility that’s important.</p>
<p>When the market gets it wrong, then implied volatility will move relative to historical volatility.  If the market guesses too high, then implied volatility will shrink relative to historical.  If the market guesses too low, then implied volatility will expand.</p>
<p>Now, remember that implied volatility is the great unknown in the equation used to calculate theoretical value.  So, if implied volatility rises, so does theoretical value.  And, if implied volatility falls, then theoretical value falls too.  This is the reason that volatility is so important and how it affects <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/video/play/video-script-options-premium/">option premium</a>.</p>

                <description
      ><![CDATA[
                    
                      <p>Why do you invest? Why do you trade? Why do you spend your nights and weekend studying how to make a few bucks in the market? Because you want to make money! By applying some time, money, and knowledge you can be better off financially, right? Heck, who doesn’t want that? Maybe not my friend Eddie—I think he’s a monk or something :).<br /></p>
<h2>Maybe I can become the next Warren Buffett</h2>
<p>Ok, you’ve got the time...check. You’ve got some extra cheddar in the bank...check. What you need is some knowledge. Specifically, where to start? I think most of us start by reading everything we can about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett">Warren Buffett</a>. He made a few pennies by applying our recipe of time, money, and knowledge. </p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/warren-buffet.jpg?mtime=20170926133049" alt="Warren Buffet Day Trading" title="Warren Buffet Day Trading" /></figure><p>But after diving into Warren’s investment strategy, you quickly realize it’s not for you. We want riches today—not when we’re 80. We want a quick buck! Next stop, Day Trading! We all have visions of facing a wall of monitors while we sit at a desk pressing buttons, making thousands of dollars day after day. So you start day trading...</p>
<h2>Day trading here I come</h2>
<p>People all over the internet claim to make riches day trading. You want to be like them. Heck, some of them sell you books and courses. Maybe you also buy a few new computer monitors. Now you're ready to day trade. On your first day you nearly double your money. You're crushing it! Maybe you crush it for an entire year. Maybe even a few years. Warren Buffett is a chump compared to you!</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width800/guy-day-trading.jpg?mtime=20170926132726" alt="Guy Day Trading" title="Guy Day Trading" /><figcaption>(Do you really want to be like this guy?)</figcaption></figure><p>And then the day comes. You thought you were too smart for this to happen to you. You really thought this day would never come. But it did. You blew up your account. No more trading capital. The arm candy you had been dating just took off. No money, no love :). Rock bottom. Well, maybe not true rock bottom. Let's hope you only day traded with a small portion of your savings.</p>
<p>You have seen how you can get rich trading the market. It’s in your crawl. But how can you do things differently so that you <em>always</em> crush it and never blow up your account? You scour the internet looking for the holy grail of trading. And then it happens—you discover options trading!</p>
<h2>Options trading is my new arm candy</h2>
<p>When I say options trading I don’t mean <em>directional</em> options trading. Directional options trading is nothing more than using options as a way to leverage your day trades. Buying stock in Apple and hoping it goes up by the end of the day is the same thing as buying options in Apple and hoping it goes up by the end of the day. With <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/directional-options-trading-is-not-for-me-typically">directional options</a> trading you can use far less capital to make the same return, but at the end of the day it’s the same form of gambling.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/Arm-Candy.jpg?mtime=20170926134640" alt="Arm Candy" title="Arm Candy" /></figure><p>
</p>
<p>Options trading is, for me, probability-based options trading. Using probability and statistics to determine the expected move of a particular underlying asset (aka stock). </p>
<p>Before we get too deep, let's set the stage. This type of trading doesn’t involve 12 monitors mounted on your wall. It doesn’t require you to sit in front of your computer every day for hours on end. It’s a nice hybrid between Warren Buffett’s buy and hold approach and adrenaline-filled day trading. Sounds pretty good to me—more free time and more money!</p>
<h2>How the most successful options traders trade</h2>
<p>As I said, some of the best options traders use probability and statistics to form a trading strategy. They don’t place directional trades, trying to gamble on if a stock will go up or down. Most options traders place trades where they don’t care if the stock goes up or down. Though they might care if the stock moves up or down in a big way in a short period of time—more on that later.</p>
<p>Most successful options traders use <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/university/optionvolatility/">volatility</a> and <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/how-option-greeks-affect-the-premium-you-trade">options greeks</a> to determine the likelihood of a particular underlying asset performing in a particular way. Then, instead of jumping on the directional bandwagon this type of options trader places trades that profit from the expectation of the move. </p>
<p>Before going into the nuts and bolts of this type of trading, let’s explore an analogy—take insurance companies, for example. Typically you pay your car insurance company a monthly sum in exchange for coverage should something bad happen. Of course, insurance companies are in business to make a profit. They need to collect more in total monthly payments than the total they have to pay out. They are banking on the fact that they can predict the percentage of their customers who will get into an accident—and the percentage who will not. </p>
<p>Say you send your car insurance company a $100 check for a month of coverage. If you make it the entire month without any accidents the insurance company wins. The insurance company knows, based on models of past performance, that most of the time they will win and every so often they will lose. They price the insurance they offer to account for this calculation. As an options trader you can mimic this type of transaction. You can become your own little insurance company. </p>
<h2>Use fear to sell premium in the options market</h2>
<p>Say you're a big hedge fund with billions under management and you’re unsure where the market is going. You can’t simply sell all your stock and go to all cash (too much to sell—the selling would move the market). One option (no pun intended; maybe) would be to buy some insurance in the form of put options. </p>
<p>In accordance with the concept of supply and demand, the cost of buying put options will increase as big hedge funds start buying them to protect their portfolios. The more managers reach for protection, the more the put options will cost. </p>
<p>No one knows the future—if anyone did they would be even richer than Mr. Buffet. So the insurance buying from big hedge funds is often precautionary and overdone. From the price managers are paying for these put options, in addition to some other factors, we can gauge what investors are expecting the market to move. This measure is often referred to as <em>volatility</em>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIX">VIX</a>, aka the fear index, is a measure of the volatility of the stock market as a whole.</p>
<p>So what does this have to do with you? You’re just a small retail investor—for now at least. Well, you can take advantage of the big hedge funds’ eagerness to buy insurance. You can sell it to them. Just like the car insurance companies sell it to you.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width400/Options-Premium.jpg?mtime=20170926135345" alt="Options Premium" title="Options Premium" /></figure><p>As I mentioned, through supply and demand options pricing can get out of whack. Here is how you take advantage of that. Let's say options pricing is suggesting the market will move 5% in the next 30 days. You sort of know that’s out of whack. <a href="https://www.optionsplaybook.com/options-introduction/what-is-volatility/">Implied volatility</a> is way overdone. Why not sell puts based on this 5% implied move? You sell a put option contract and collect some premium just like an insurance company would.</p>
<p>How does this work? Let's say you sell (or write) a put options contract on the <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/being-hyperfocused-on-the-spy">SPY</a> (ETF that tracks the S&amp;P 500). You write this contract 5% out of the money (the current price of the SPY). This options contact expires within the next 30 days. If the SPY closes down more than 5% in 30 days you lose money. In our analogy this is the equivalent of what happens when you crash your car and the insurance company pays to settle the claim. If instead the market stays above a 5% loss in 30 days, you keep the premium you collected when you sold the put option on the SPY.</p>
<p>Pretty simple right? In this example the SPY could go up in value, stay flat, or go down in value less than 5% and in each case you win. </p>
<p>To put some context to this idea let's look at my post <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/how-often-the-spy-falls-more-than-5-in-a-30-day-period-and-why-you-should-care">How Often the SPY Falls More Than 5% in a 30-Day Period and Why You Should Care</a>. In this missive I show that <em>during any 30-day period from 1993 through 2014 the SPY closed down 5% or more 11% of the time</em>. Using this historical information, if you sold a put 5% <a href="http://www.call-options.com/out-of-the-money.html">out of the money</a> 11% of the time you would lose the trade—meaning the SPY closed down more than 5% in a 30-day window. </p>
<p>Just like car insurers have a model to estimate how many people will place claims in a year you can estimate how many times you will lose a particular put selling trade.</p>
<h2>An options strategy that will gain you monthly income</h2>
<p>It’s time to put all of this together. There are lots of strategies you can use to leverage the concepts I highlighted in this post. What I am about to share is how I like to <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/baseline-strategy-for-trading-spy-put-credit-spreads">trade put credit spreads</a> on the SPY over and over again. I do not suggest blindly copying what I do. I suggest exploring different ideas and find the strategy that suits you best.</p>
<p>Earlier I talked about selling put options on the SPY and collecting a premium—most likely selling to those sucker hedge funds :). There is one downside to this approach. The losses can be pretty big. Think about it this way: if you get in a fender bender your auto insurance might have to shell out thousands in repairs. But if you total your car, your insurance company might be buying you a new car (maybe $40,000?). That’s a big range. Selling a naked put option can be the same way. The more the market tanks the more you pay out. </p>
<p>Did you know insurance companies buy something called <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/reinsurance.asp">reinsurance</a>? Your insurance company has an insurance company of its own. Your insurance company buys insurance to cap its losses. So if you total your car and your insurance company buys you a new car, its insurance company might be paying half of that bill. So why not buy a form of reinsurance on your put option?</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/options-growth-2.png?mtime=20170926135855" alt="Options Income Growth" title="Options Income Growth" /></figure><p>To insure a naked put position I often buy a put option (my own reinsurance) further out of the money. In the example above we <strong>sold</strong> a put option 5% out of the money. I might go and <strong>buy</strong> another put option 8% out of the money so I would only have to cover losses between 5% and 8% out of the money. If the SPY dropped 12% I would pay the first 8% and the put option I purchased would pay the remaining 4%. This trade is called a <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">put credit spread</a>. </p>
<p>By placing a put credit spread I am limiting my maximum loss, but I am also limiting my profit. I have to take out of my profits the cost of the put option I purchased.</p>
<p>By placing these put credit spread trades over and over again I generate monthly income that’s similar to day trading profits. The difference is I’m not gambling the way I would have to with day trading. I predict that 11% of the time I will lose and 89% of the time I will win. I limit my losses by buying protective puts. </p>
<p>My rule of thumb is this: whenever there is a put credit spread on the SPY that expires within 45 days and gives me a credit of $20 per lot or more, I place that trade. Often this strategy works out to 2 trades a week. In a good year this strategy returns 90+%, and over time this strategy returns 20 to 30% <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cagr.asp">CAGR</a> (that is CAGR, not pure return). I have never seen a day trading strategy that does this well year after year. Though yes, day trading might beat this strategy for a few years.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I had one very simple goal in this post: convince you that there are better alternatives to day trading. Most people do not succeed at day trading long term. You can get wrapped up in the idea of big percentage gains month after month. But take a moment to do one simple exercise. Put all the gains you think you will make month after month day trading into a spreadsheet. My guess is you’ll be a billionaire within a few years, right? Now look at the Forbes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/#640ae147251c">richest people list</a>. Did any of them get rich day trading? Nope. If it was easy someone would have figured it out by now. </p>
<p>This type of options trading only became possible for the retail investor in the last 5 to 10 years. It’s pretty new, which is why you haven’t heard much about it. I am not saying probability-based options trading will make you a billionaire. What I am saying is the odds of long-term success are much more in your favor.</p>
<p>I will add that there is a time and place for day trading. Heck, I’ve even <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/how-i-day-trade-the-spy">blogged</a> about it. Day trading should be for a very small amount of your capital and mainly used to stay engaged in the market and have a little fun. I don’t think day trading should be the bulk of your trading strategy.</p>

      ><![CDATA[<p>The short butterfly option trading strategy is a good way to earn small profits, while keeping downside risk to a bare minimum. If you think a stock is set to experience a sizeable move, either up or down, break out your short butterfly playbook.</p>]]></summary>
                <description
      ><![CDATA[
                    
                      <p>When a stock looks poised for a significant rise or fall, it may be time for a short butterfly play. This option strategy will profit if the underlying stock moves in either direction, so it’s a good choice when you expect a major price movement, but aren’t sure in which direction it will be.</p>
<p>For instance, say a pharmaceutical company is soon to release news about a recent study on the effectiveness of an experimental drug. It’s possible that the results could be mediocre; but you think it’s more likely that the results will be significant, sending the stock price up or down considerably. If you guess correctly, the short butterfly will earn a nice profit. If you turn out wrong, the loss is capped. </p>
<h2>Taking a Short Butterfly Position </h2>
<p>The short butterfly strategy involves four option contracts. Two of them are purchased at-the-money, while another is sold in-the-money, and the fourth is written out-of-the-money. All of them have the same expiration dates and are of the same derivative type, either calls or puts. The two strike prices above and below the center point should be equidistant from the center strike. Whether using puts or calls, a net credit is received when entering the trade. Any commission paid will of course reduce the income earned.  </p>
<h2>Short Butterfly Example</h2>
<p>Suppose that <a href="http://quotes.wsj.com/ABT">Abbott Laboratories</a> (ticker symbol ABT) is about to publish a study on a promising drug used to treat blood diseases. If the research is favorable, the stock price will probably increase significantly; and if the analysis shows the medicine is ineffective, the company’s stock price will likely suffer. </p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/short-put-butterfly-risk-graph.jpg?mtime=20170920191337" alt="" /></figure><p>You decide that a short butterfly strategy has a high probability of profiting from the impending news, whatever it may be. The stock is trading at $50, so you purchase two <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-option">put contracts</a> with $50 strikes. You simultaneously sell another put contract with a $51 strike, while writing a fourth put option with a $49 strike. All four contracts have the same expiration dates.<br /></p>
<p>The two center options cost $75 each, for a total of $150. The upper contract earns $30, while the lower contract, which is out-of-the-money, earns a very nice $140. The total amount received is $170, while the total spent is $150. The net credit is $20, which will be reduced by any commission paid. </p>
<p>After a week, you hear in the news that Abbott Labs has cancelled the study, because several patients developed severe side effects from the drug. Investors send the stock price down to $43. The two options you purchased are worth $700 each at expiration, while the short contract with the highest strike is worth $800, and the lowest-strike contract has a value of $600. You can exit these last two positions by buying to close. Doing so costs $1,400, and you have the other two long contracts that are worth a total of $1,400. The contracts obviously offset each other, leaving the $20 credit obtained at the outset. </p>
<h2>Maximum Loss and Gain</h2>
<p>The $20 earned is the maximum gain for our example. Because there are two shorted contracts with two long contracts in the butterfly spread, the options will always negate each other if they are in-the-money, assuming that the strike prices of the butterfly’s wings are equidistant from the center strike, which they should be.</p>
<p>If the stock moves in the opposite direction, all derivatives will be out-of-the-money with no value. This also leaves the $20 net credit earned at the start of the trade. If the stock hovers around the center strike value, one of the shorted contracts will be in-the-money. Upon exercise, this will decrease the net credit or produce a loss on the trade. </p>
<h2>Equations</h2>
<p>Looking at what we have learned in our example with Abbott, the following equations are revealed:</p>
<blockquote>Maximum loss = 100 × (Center strike – Lower strike) – net credit + commission</blockquote>
<blockquote>Maximum profit = Net credit – commission</blockquote>
<p>Because the short butterfly play has these caps, only limited gains can be made with it. But the limits also create an inherent safety mechanism that makes the short butterfly safer than many security investments, including equity trading. </p>

                      <p>Investing comes with risks, that’s a fact of life. Generally speaking, the greater the risks, the greater the potential for profits. In these regards, options trading offers a high potential for profits, but does come with some higher risks. This is especially true for newer investors. Experienced and/or well-educated options traders, however, can utilize a variety of strategies to lower risks. For newer investors, paper trading options is a great way to get started.<br /></p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/how-to-paper-trade-options.jpg?mtime=20170919204504" alt="How To Paper Trade Options" title="How To Paper Trade Options" /></figure><p>Given all of the risks associated with investing, it’s important for investors to pay close attention to what they are doing, to be conscious of risks, and to constantly stay up to date on the market. For investors who are new to the game, one great way to get started is with “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_simulator">paper trading</a>”, which refers to simulated investing with fake money. Paper trading is especially great for traditional investors who want to learn about options trading.<br /></p>
<p>A variety of <a href="https://options.cafe/options-broker-finder">stock brokers</a> and other organizations now provide a variety of trading simulation tools and paper trading options. These tools allow you to execute trades based on up-to-date market data, but instead of risking real money, you use fake money. You can then monitor your performance based on real-world market data. In other words, paper trading is very similar to actual investing, but you don’t have to risk your money.</p>
<h2>Where Can I Find an Options Paper Trading System?</h2>
<p>There are many great paper trading options and simulators available on the Internet. Some of them specialize in certain assets, such as futures or options. Others allow you to trade a variety of assets. Let’s briefly highlight some of the more popular paper trading platforms:</p>
<p>Investopedia- this popular investing education platform also offers a great paper <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/simulator">trading platform</a>. You can paper trade stocks, options, and other assets on Investopedia, making a great choice for people who want to try various investments.</p>
<p>OptionsXpress- this website offers a great <a href="http://www.optionsxpress.com/promos/optionsvt.aspx">platform</a> for paper trading options. You start out with $25,000 dollars in fake money, and can start trading right away. </p>
<p>MarketWatch- features a bare bones and perhaps difficult to use interface. However, their <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/game/paper-trading">Virtual Stock Exchange simulator</a> offers great opportunities for paper options trading.</p>
<p>There are many other stock and option simulators out there. If none of the above suit your fancy, go ahead and search around for other options. So long as the paper trading system allows you to make a variety of trades and is based on real-time information, you’ll be afforded plenty of opportunities to learn.</p>
<h2>Who Should Use Paper Trading and Why?</h2>
<p>Paper trading is a fantastic choice for people who are new to investing, or are trying out a new type of investment vehicle, such as <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-call-option">options</a>. For example, if you’ve been steadily building up your retirement and stock portfolio, and want to expand into options, starting with paper trading makes a lot of sense. You’ll be able to learn how investing works and can also tinker with various strategies. While reading blog posts from thought leaders like <a href="https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/">Tasty Trade</a> is a great way to increase your investing knowledge and skill, at the end of the day experience is also essential.</p>
<p>Quite simply, picking up knowledge is one thing, while implementing it is another. There are tons of fantastic option trading strategies that can help traders reduce risk and increase the potential for profits. <a href="https://options.cafe/">Options Cafe</a> and other websites work hard to provide as many insights and opportunities as possible. Yet at the end of the day, you as an investor must put that knowledge to work. You have to conduct the trades and you have to manage your portfolio. Paper trading offers a great way to test theories and learn the ropes, while not exposing yourself to unnecessary risks.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/use-graphs-when-paper-trading-options.jpg?mtime=20170919203806" alt="Use Graphs When Paper Trading Options" title="Use Graphs When Paper Trading Options" /></figure><p>Paper trading is especially important for options because premiums, fees, and time decay will all play a big role in your investment strategies and will impact your profits or losses. With stocks, many trading strategies allow you to simply focus on price. With options, there are more considerations that you have to pay close attention to. Paper trading options will help you learn how to focus on these different aspects and variables.<br /></p>
<p>However, there are some downsides to paper investing. Most importantly, it’s simply not real. Even if you start making a lot of “money” off of paper trading, you’re not really making any profit at all. Further, many traders do great with paper trading because they are unencumbered by fear. Without real money at stake, investing can be a relaxing and feel more like a video game rather than wealth management. Making big, bold trades is easy, and often those bold moves will produce big “profits.” Once real money comes into play, however, many investors tighten up, and their trading strategies change, even if subconsciously, and often for the worse.</p>
<p>Let’s jump into how you can properly utilize paper trading options, while also digging deeper into the limitations of simulations and how you can overcome them without exposing yourself to too much risk.</p>
<h2>Putting Paper Trading To The Best Use</h2>
<p>Not ready to jump into options trading with live money? That’s okay. Paper trading options offers an excellent way to get started. With paper trading, markets are live but the money you invest isn’t. This means that the simulations are highly accurate and will reflect real world conditions.</p>
<p>When you invest the fake dollars, treat it like a real trade. If you’re a risk averse trader, then you should focus on making paper trades that mitigate risks. If you’re willing to expose yourself to more risk, go ahead and do so. Just make sure you’re being honest.</p>
<p>Of course, with paper trading you can also test new ideas, higher risk trades, etc. in order to learn new strategies. You might be intimidated by the risks involved with options trading, but after paper trading you might quickly find that you actually have a knack for it. The same is true of individual strategies. Some options trading strategies are much lower in risk, but generally have restrained profit potential. Other strategies offer great profit potential, but also carry higher risks. </p>
<p>In order to learn, it’s important to think through each trade. Why are you buying an option for this stock? How can you use an iron condor in that market? Don’t just throw darts at the wall and hope that your trades bear fruit. Be strategic. As you conduct paper trades with options, some of them will undoubtedly turn sour. Don’t get discouraged, take it as an opportunity to learn! Sit down and try to figure out why that particular options trade didn’t turn out well. </p>
<p>While paper trading options offers a great way to get started and to learn, nothing beats real, live experience. Of course, investing can be intimidating. With opportunities come risks, and it is possible that you will lose some money. This is true of any investment vehicle, including stocks, bonds, futures, Forex, options, and all the rest. Options tend to have a higher risk profile, but also a higher profit potential. Further, various options strategies can be used to mitigate risks. </p>
<p>Regardless, many investors get nervous when they start options investing. The transition from paper trading to real-live options investing is often bumpy for investors. Yet if you’re serious about making money, you have to get serious about investing real money. That’s why Options Cafe recommends transitioning from paper trading to real trading as soon as you’re comfortable with both options trading basics and the options strategies you plan on utilizing.</p>
<p>Before betting the house, however, we recommend that you start with a smaller  amount of “<a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/08/20/what-is-risk-capital.aspx">risk capital</a>”. Let’s jump into what that means.</p>
<h2>Start Options Trading With a Small Amount</h2>
<p>Don’t want to risk your retirement portfolio with options trading? That’s a wise idea. While options trading has a fantastic potential to produce profits, there is a risk of losing money as well. If you’ve learned all that you can learn from paper trading options and are ready to jump into options trading, it’s smart to start investing with a smaller amount, say $2,000 dollars. </p>
<p>This way, you will limit your exposure. Yes, you’ll also limit your profit potential, but that’s okay for newer investors. Obviously, no one wants to lose or even risk $2,000 dollars if they don’t have to. However, you can think of this initial investment as an educational opportunity as well (more on that later). </p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/use-real-money-when-paper-trading-options.png?mtime=20170919203438" alt="Use Real Money When Paper Trading Options" title="Use Real Money When Paper Trading Options" /></figure><p><br /></p>
<p>When you first start investing in options, you should limit yourself to “risk” capital. This refers to money you can afford to lose. No one wants to lose money, of course, but many people can afford to lose a certain amount before it starts to really affect their life style.</p>
<p>For example, you might start by trading with $2,000 dollars. When it comes to options trading, fees, commissions, and all the rest mean that you will generally produce limited profits with only $2,000 dollars invested. However, by limiting your exposure, you won’t be putting yourself at serious risk.</p>
<p>Even if the nearly inconceivable happens and you lose all $2,000 dollars of your investment, you likely won’t lose your home or vehicle. Yet by investing with real money, even a small amount, you’ll start to see how you react to the pressures of a live market and live risks. Often, you will find your reactions to be different from when you were paper trading options. This is normal, but do take note. </p>
<p>If your trading is detrimentally impacted, which quite frankly is common, you need to sit down and take a deep breath. What strategies produced results when you were paper trading options? How can you implement them now? Remember, you’re only trading risk capital, so it’s okay to take some risks. </p>
<p>On the other hand, it’s usually a bad idea to overexpose yourself when you are just beginning to trade options. Even if you’ve enjoyed a ton of success with paper options trading, it’s not a good idea to jump in with large investments right away. By easing in, you’ll reduce risks and set yourself up for a higher chance of long-term success. </p>
<h2>The Best Platforms for Small-Capital Options Investing</h2>
<p>So you’re ready to invest some risk capital in options trading. You’ve already managed an account on Investopedia or another options paper trading simulator. Now you want to jump in. Which options broker should you use? There are tons of <a href="https://options.cafe/options-broker-finder">options brokers</a>, and many of them have their own unique advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>We don’t want to discourage you from shopping around for an options broker, but in our experience <a href="https://tastyworks.com">Tastyworks.com</a> is the best broker for newer investors who are trading with smaller amounts. They are great for options trading with large amounts as well, but when it comes to limited capital investing few platforms offer as competitive of fees and commissions.</p>
<h2>Newer Investors Should Think of Their Investing as an Educational Experience</h2>
<p>There’s no getting around it: when you start investing in options there is a risk that you will lose some money. It’s possible, even if unlikely, that you could lose all $2,000 dollars or whatever your initial investment is. Don’t let that intimidate you, and remember that even Warren Buffet and other world-class investors make bad investments from time to time.</p>
<p>Further, every time you invest you are creating an opportunity to learn. There’s an old saying, “practice makes perfect”, and that’s true for investors as well. Every time you invest, you are creating an opportunity to learn, and as you learn you can improve. People always say education is invaluable, and that’s true. However, we can put some hard numbers to it as well.</p>
<p>Think about how much tuition at a university is. In-state tuition at many public tuitions is now above $15,000 dollars per year. Private schools (many of which have the best investing and finance programs) can top $40,000 dollars per year! Each year, hundreds of thousands of students and their families fork over their savings accounts for education. In the long run, however, it’s usually worth it. A bachelor’s degree along can equate to $2.3 million dollars or more in lifetime earnings, on average, over a high school only degree.</p>
<p>In that context, options investing is actually quite cheap, and the education can be just as valuable, and for some options traders, even more so. Of course, paper trading options is free, so even if you’re a bit skeptical, give it a shot. There’s no risks. Having trouble producing profits? Recalibrate your trading strategies. With time, effort, and patience, you’ll all quite likely start producing profits.</p>

                      <p>Today I’m going to walk you through the mechanics of what I look for as I set up a new trade using option greeks. I pay close attention to the Greeks to get a feel for how my trade is going to behave between the time I put it on and the time it expires.  Today, I’m looking at a bull call spread on <a href="https://stocktwits.com/symbol/AAOI">Applied Optoelectronics, Inc</a>. (<strong>AAOI</strong>).  Before we look at the Option Greeks, let me give you the rundown of what I’m looking at on this stock.</p>
<h2>When Trading Option Greeks Consider The Underlying First</h2>
<p>I trade AAOI a lot.  It presents continual options opportunities, so it’s always on my watchlist.  The company reported earnings the week before I put on this trade.  While they beat consensus numbers, they offered cautious guidance for the next quarter.  So, the stock just got crushed.  It has lost some 34% of its value since the company reported.  Nothing else has changed fundamentally, so I’m back in.</p>
<p>I’m setting up a bull call spread with regular September expiration.  That’s just 37 days away…but my sense is I’ll be out of the trade before then (hopefully with a gain).  The options market is telling me that the expected move between now and then is about 11.25 points.  So, that’s where I’m going to look at my strikes for this spread.  Let’s see what the Greeks are telling us.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/Options_Trading_The_Greeks.jpg?mtime=20170912211747" alt="Trading Option Greeks Chart" title="Trading Option Greeks Chart" /></figure><h2>Next Look at The Greeks</h2>
<p>Because this is a vertical spread I’m long some Delta and I’m short some Delta.  I’ve circled this as # 1 in the image above.  When you do the math, you’ll see that I’ve got hardly any net Delta at all; just 6.93.  That means that for every 1 point move in AAOI stock, this spread is going to advance less than 7-cents.  Doesn’t sound like much, but when you consider that we put on this spread for just 58-cents, that’s not a bad move – especially for this high-beta stock.<br /></p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/Options_Trading_The_Greeks_Send_Order.jpg?mtime=20170912212229" alt="Chart For Trading Option Greeks" title="Chart For Trading Option Greeks" /></figure><h2>How The Options Greeks Could Go Wrong?</h2>
<p>So, the next thing to look at is # 2, Theta.  Here again, it’s a net number.  And, between now and the close of business tomorrow this puppy is going to lose 0.83-cents of its value to time decay.  The important thing to remember is that Theta is right now as low as it’s going to be for the rest of this contract’s life.  It’s only going to get bigger, and bigger, and bigger from here.  And, it’s going to get bigger at a faster pace every day for the next 37 days.  So, again, I better be right on the direction of this stock or this baby is going to expire worthless!</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/Trading-The-Greeks.jpg?mtime=20170912215107" alt="Trading Option Greeks" title="Trading Option Greeks" /></figure><p>Now, let’s look at # 3.  You’ll notice that there are two circles labeled # 3.  They are related.  Look at the circle to the left.  That’s the one over Vega.  Here again, we see that because we’re long one strike and short the other, Vega is a net number.  It’s 1.26.  This tells me that if implied volatility increases one percent (or one point) then my net premium is going to go up 1.26-cents.  If it goes down one percent, then my premium shrinks by 1.26-cents.</p>
<h2>What Could Go Right?</h2>
<p>Now look at the # 3 on the right.  Here we’re looking at implied volatility.  I’m not concerned about netting these two numbers.  I’m more concerned about where they are in relation to historical volatility.  Take a look at the image below to get a sense for that.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/Options_Trading_The_Greeks_Graph.jpg?mtime=20170912212517" alt="Image of Trading Option Greeks" title="Image of Trading Option Greeks" /></figure><p>The blue line inside the yellow oval shown in the image above is historical volatility (HV).  The red line is implied (IV).  When I took this screenshot HV was at 167.11.  IV was at 67.65.  I’ll talk more about this in the weeks ahead, but the relation between these two is so out of whack, that I think that IV will increase rather than decrease from here.  If that happens, then my net premium is going to expand right along with it.  This, oh by the way, is why I put on this trade today.<br /><br />As you can see there are lots of factors in trading option greeks understanding how they work is key to successfully trading options. Greeks drive the decisions of most options traders.</p>

                      <p>If your a follower of this blog or a follower of my trades you might have noticed I stopped posting trades. That is all about to change starting with this post. I am once again committed to posting the trades I place monthly. The reason for the absence in trade posting is we have been crazy busy preparing for the launch of our new <a href="https://options.cafe/">trading platform</a> -- Just not enough hours in the day :(. As we are getting close to the launch of the platform I have more time for posting trades. </p>
<p>As you can see only one SPY put credit spread closed in August. The markets have been very very very flat this year. So getting trade opportunities has been very hard. Hopefully as we head into the fall this will change. </p>

                      <h2>Why do I post my trades every month?</h2>
<p>I am a big fan of trading options as a form of monthly income. I think <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/how-option-greeks-affect-the-premium-you-trade">selling premium</a> in options over and over again far out performs any other investing / trading strategy that I know of. Yes, we all can make big wins day trading but it never lasts. Almost everyone blows out their account at some point. When placing probability based options trades you know how successful you should be month after month. </p>
<p>With that said -- the reason I share my trades is to spread the success of these types of strategies. My goal is to convince people looking to become day traders to move away from those ideas and embrace these ideas. </p>
<p>There are lots of strategies for selling options premium for monthly income. My strategy is outlined <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/baseline-strategy-for-trading-spy-put-credit-spreads">here</a>.  </p>

                <description
      ><![CDATA[
                    
                      <p>If you expect a stock to trade mostly sideways for the conceivable future, the butterfly option strategy may be worth taking a look at. While it has limited profitability, it also has finite risk. The most you can lose on the trade is the initial cost of entry.</p>
<h2>Setting up a Butterfly Spread</h2>
<p>To create a long butterfly spread position, you trade four option contracts simultaneously. You write two contracts that are at-the-money. At the same time, you buy one contract that is out-of the money, and purchase one more contract that is in-the-money. These final two contracts should have strike prices that are equidistant from the two contracts that were sold.</p>
<p>All four derivatives have the same expiration date and are of the same type, calls or puts. They can be either, but not a mix. </p>
<p>This option strategy gets its name from the two contracts that are traded on either side of the middle two contracts. They are considered the wings of the option play. </p>
<h2>Making and Losing Money</h2>
<p>The goal in this derivative investment is for the underlying stock to be at the shorted calls’ strike price on expiration day. This is where the greatest return is achieved. The further the stock moves from that price, the lower the return or the greater the loss will be, up to a certain point. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/long-call-butterfly-risk-graph_170910_185710.jpg?mtime=20170910115710" alt="Butterfly Spread Profit Loss Graph" title="Butterfly Spread Profit Loss Graph" /></figure><p><br /></p>
<p>Because there are two short options and two long options, if the stock makes a move that causes the two short options to gain intrinsic value, the other two options, which are of the same type, will also increase in value. Thus, this strategy always negates losses.<br /></p>
<h2>Example of a Long Butterfly Spread</h2>
<p>Suppose you noticed that General Mills (ticker GIS) has been moving sideways for some time. You expect this trend to continue based on your technical and fundamental studies. Although you don’t have a lot of risk capital, you decide to use a butterfly derivative strategy to earn a little extra income, knowing that the investment is limited in risk. </p>
<p>The stock is trading at $60. You sell two call options, each with a strike price of $60. You also buy one call with a strike of $55 and another call with a strike of $65. All four securities have the same expiration date. </p>
<blockquote><strong>Buy 1 ITM Call ($50)
<br />Sell 2 ATM Calls ($60)
<br />Buy 1 OTM Call ($65)</strong>
</blockquote>
<p>The written calls produce a revenue of $1.50 each. Because there are two contracts of 100 shares apiece, the profit is $300. </p>
<p>The contract with the lower strike costs 80¢ per share, while the upper-strike contract is priced at $2.60 per share. The cost of the long contracts is $340. Subtracting this amount from the revenue generated from the written contracts produces a $40 cost for the entire trade. </p>
<p>If GIS stays at $60 and ends there on the expiration date, the two written contracts will be worthless, and so will the call contract you hold at $65. The final contract with a strike of $55 has $5 of intrinsic value per share, producing a profit of $500, which is the total gain from this butterfly strategy. Subtracting $500 from the $40 net debit produces a net gain of $460 for the butterfly investment, not calculating any commissions paid. </p>
<p>On the other hand, if General Mills had reported above-average earnings and the stock price went to $70, all four contracts would have intrinsic value. The two short contracts would be worth $1,000 each, producing a total loss of $2,000. The contract with the lower strike would be worth $1,500, while the higher-strike call would have a value of $500. Clearly, the long and short contracts cancel out, leaving just the cost of entry as the total loss. </p>
<h2>Butterfly Equations</h2>
<p>Looking at the numbers in the General Mills example, we can determine the following equations, which show the breakeven points:</p>
<blockquote><strong>Upper break-even level = Highest strike price – net premium paid – commissions</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Lower break-even level = Lowest strike price + net premium paid + commissions</strong></blockquote>
<p>Notice that the more you pay in commissions and premiums, the narrower the range of profit. </p>

                      <p>Today I’m going to go over <em>Option Greeks</em>: what they are; what their impact is on premium; and, what you ought to be looking for as you set up a trade.</p>
<p>For some of you, this post will be remedial.  For others it may be a helpful refresher.  And, for sure others, this information may be completely new material.  Readers that don’t already have at least some experience with options – either trading them or reading about them – may miss some important points.  So, if you are not familiar with basic options terminology, then you may have a hard time following along. </p>
<h2>What Are Option Greeks?</h2>
<p>The Greeks are a collection of metrics that help a trader understand how option <a href="https://www.dough.com/blog/options-premium">premium</a> is going to change in relation to a move in something else.  There are five Greeks.  They are Delta, Gamma, Rho, Theta, and Vega.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/Option-Greeks.png?mtime=20170903103643" alt="Option Greeks" title="Option Greeks" /></figure><p>Right off the bat, I’m going to tell you that I don’t pay any attention to Rho.  Rho tells you how premium is going to change with a 1% move, up or down, in interest rates.  Now, the likelihood that you’re going to see that big a move in rates before a contract expires is not very high.  This is especially the case if most of the trades you make go out fewer than 60 days.  So, unless your trading methodology centers around buying or selling LEAPs, I suggest that you don’t need to pay much attention to Rho.</p>
<p>Now, with that said, some day interest rates may be higher than they are now.  You never know. So, just in case that happens, here’s how Rho affects premium.  If interest rates rise by 1%, then a call’s premium will decrease by the value of its Rho.  Call premium will increase by the value of Rho when interest rates fall by 1%.  The exact opposite is true of put premium.  The reason a change in interest rates will affect premium is because it costs money to maintain an open options position.  When interest rates rise the cost to carry a position becomes more expensive.  When rates fall, the cost to carry becomes less expensive.  Rho compensates for this and adjusts premium accordingly.</p>
<h2>Gamma, Gamma, Gamma!</h2>
<p>Another one of the Option Greeks that I don’t consider when setting up a trade is Gamma.  Gamma tells us how much Delta is going to move with each one-point change in the underlying.  If Delta is at .50 and Gamma is at .10 and the underlying moves up by one point, then Delta will move to .60.  If the underlying declines by one point, then Delta will go to .40.  Gamma affects puts the exact same way it affects calls.  But, bear in mind that this assumes you’re long.  When you’re long Gamma is a positive number.  When you’re short, it’s negative.  Gamma is at its zenith when the option is at-the-money and trails off the further the option goes in-the-money or out-of-the-money.</p>
<p>The reason that I don’t factor Gamma into my decision making when I model out a trade is because if I’ve gotten the other components right, then Gamma will just be along for the ride.  And, if I’m in a trade that goes south, then it’s because something else went wrong.  Gamma won’t be the cause of either a winning or a losing trade.  Winners and losers will be much more affected by Delta, Theta, and Vega. </p>
<h2>The Big Three – Delta, Theta, and Vega – The Must Know Greeks</h2>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/option-greeks.jpg?mtime=20170903142527" alt="Different Types Of Option Greeks" title="Different Types Of Option Greeks" /><figcaption>

</figcaption></figure><h2>Delta....</h2>
<p>Delta tells you how much premium is going to change with every one-point move, up or down, in the value of the underlying.  It’s expressed as a decimal number.  So, for example, if an option you’re considering has a Delta of .50 the ramification of a one-point move in the underlying is a 50-cent move in premium.  Traders also use Delta as a predictor of the likelihood that a given option will be in-the-money at expiration.  So, traders say that an option with a .30 Delta has just a 30% chance of expiring in-the-money.  But, one with a .80 Delta has an 80% chance.<br /></p>
<p>Each Delta lies on a continuum numerically between 0 and 1.00.  Call Deltas are positive; put Deltas are negative.  When an option is at-the-money, a call’s Delta will be at .50 and a put’s Delta will be at -.50.  As you set up trades you should be using Delta to help you model your exit strategy (assuming the trade goes to plan) based on an assumed price target for the underlying.  The other Greek that you want to pay close attention to is Theta.</p>
<h2>Theta - What You Need To Know</h2>
<p>Time value is an option’s excess premium over and above its intrinsic value and the rate at which an option loses time value is represented by its Theta.  Time value wastes away at an exponential rate.  The closer the calendar gets to expiration, the more rapidly an option loses time value.  On any given trading day, Theta represents the amount of premium that will be lost to time decay by the close of business tomorrow.  And, then tomorrow, it will do the same thing all over again, except that Theta will be a bigger number.</p>
<p>Losing premium to time value is good if you’re short.  When you sell a position, you’re looking for it to expire worthless.  So, Theta is your ally.  The opposite is the case if you’re long.  Being long Theta requires that you pay close attention during trade setup.</p>
<p>The reason for this is that you’ll want to know how much your trade is at risk if the underlying doesn’t go in your direction pretty quickly.  The longer you have to sit around and wait for the underlying to move, the quicker that contract is going to lose value.  Even if the underlying is moving higher the contract will still lose premium unless the option is deep in-the-money.</p>
<h2>Vega - Volatility In Da House</h2>
<p>So, when setting up a trade you want to make sure that you avoid strikes that are ridiculously out-of-the-money and that you give yourself plenty of time to have the underlying make the move you anticipate.  And, that brings us to the last Option Greek you need to pay attention to: Vega.  This is the most important one in my opinion.</p>
<p>For me, trading options is really all about trading volatility.  The one variable that has the greatest impact on premium is implied volatility (IV).  If it expands, premium expands; if it contracts, premium contracts.  The rate at which this expansion or contraction will take place is revealed to us by Vega.  It tells us how much our premium is going to change with every one percent move in IV.</p>
<p>So, when you set up a trade you want to make sure that you understand how Vega sensitive your position is.  For example, if you’re long and Vega is a big number, then you want IV to expand.  If it does, then your premium will increase by the percent change in IV multiplied by Vega.  If you’re short and Vega is a big number, then you want IV to shrink.  That will also shrink premium in the exact same manner; percent change in IV multiplied by Vega.  Understanding Vega will help you to understand how much volatility risk you have in a position as well as help you model out possible exit points and stop losses.</p>
<p>Paying attention to Option Greeks as you set up new trades will help to make them more successful.  And, in the next installment of this blog I’ll show you the things I look for from them when I set up a trade.</p>

                      <p>Hello options traders, in a previous article I discussed <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/long-delta-strategies-what-is-delta">Delta</a>, and how to use it to make profitable trades. What many traders don’t consider is that your delta doesn’t <em>have</em> to stay consistent throughout a trade. Many professional options traders manage their positions in order to add or decrease delta. Let’s discuss some methods and benefits of managing the delta of positions before they expire.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/money-500x458.png?mtime=20170901235458" alt="Making Money Trading Delta Options" title="Making Money Trading Delta Options" /></figure><p>One downside to utilizing high <a href="https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/learn/probability-of-profit">probability of profit</a> (POP) trades, especially <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-so-special-about-option-credit-spreads">credit spreads</a>, is that they can turn very ugly if the underlying stock moves against you. The maximum loss in high POP trades is often much larger than the maximum profit. Most of the time, these trades work out great, and are reliable and consistent. What can we do to minimize our losses on a losing credit spread?</p>
<h2>Never Follow Your First Instinct</h2>
<p>
It is the first instinct of many traders to panic and close the position when they see a large loss. This is a big mistake. Holding onto to profitable trades hoping for more profit and closing losing trades while they are still losers will result in poor returns. So, should you just hold onto a losing position and pray the stock moves in your favor? Of course not! It is important to consider that in addition to closing or holding, you can add more options to your positions. </p>
<h2>Example Of How To Trade Delta Focused Options</h2>
<p>Lets imagine you’ve opened up a put credit spread on a stock. Some bad news comes out, and the stock plummets. You are now at a loss, and it appears that the stock shows no sign of stopping its fall. What can you do? Well, instead of closing, you can simply reduce your delta. By nature, put credit spreads have a positive delta. To reduce your delta, you simply have to enter an option position in the same underlying with a negative delta. This could be selling a call spread, buying a put spread, or even simply buying a put. I personally recommend selling a call spread, therefore creating an <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/iron-condor-explained">iron condor</a>. This will help to reduce your losses should the stock continue to plummet. Just ensure your positions delta is overall positive, that way if the stock recovers you will make back a portion of your money. </p>
<p>Keep in mind that adding more options to your position does increase your max loss. It doesn’t eliminate the potential for further losses, it simply helps your position if the stock continues to move against you. It does increase your maximum potential profit as well, especially if you go the credit spread to iron condor route.</p>
<h2>Increasing Delta Is Another Way To Manage A Position</h2>
<p>Reducing delta isn’t the only way to manage a position. You can also increase your delta if you believe the stock is going to reverse, rather than continuing to drop. This is achieved in the same way that reducing delta is, but instead you simply add more options with positive delta. This way, it will require a smaller upwards correction for you to break even. I would advise against this in most cases, as if you are wrong you will lose even more than if you just held the position. As always, there is always a time and place for certain strategies. Keep your personal portfolio goals and risk toleration in mind. <br /></p>
<p>Delta in individual positions is one way to manage your delta. Options traders should also keep in mind the delta of their overall portfolio. Your portfolio delta is the sum of the delta of every option in your portfolio. If you want to collect credit and use theta as your main driver of profit, you should try to keep your delta close to zero. While you may have temporary success timing the market and making big gains, nobody can time the market forever. If your portfolio delta is very high during a bear market, you can say goodbye to your profits. Keeping your delta close to 0 ensures that you can collect  money from time decay and directional moves will have less impact.<br /></p>
<h2>Keeping Delta To Zero</h2>
<p>So what is the best way to keep your portfolio delta 0 while making money trading delta options? This is up for debate, but uses the same principle as editing position delta. If your portfolio delta is very negative, add a long position with positive delta. One strategy I like to employ when my portfolio delta gets very high is selling a call spread on an index. I choose an index that contains the underlying stocks my long positions are associated with. For example, if I’m long a lot of tech stocks, I’ll sell a call spread on the Nasdaq index, QQQ. If I’m long a lot of retail stocks, I’ll sell a call spread on a retail ETF such as XRT. Do some research to find out what ETF’s and indexes include your longs/shorts in order to reduce your delta and hedge your bets. </p>
<p>Even if you are an options seller who relies on theta, it is important to study delta. Delta is not important to directional trading exclusively, and it can be used to edit positions and hedge your bets. Stay profitable and happy making money trading delta options.<br /></p>

And, among all the variables in an option pricing model, it is the only one that is derived from market sentiment.  But, the market doesn’t always get it right.  That creates opportunity for an options trader. </p>]]></summary>
                <description
      ><![CDATA[
                    
                      <p>Buy Low Sell High! You’ve heard that old adage about a zillion times because it is the essence of what makes a good trade.  But, most novice options traders think of the term as referring only to an option’s premium.  Buying premium at a low level and then selling it at a higher level.  But, the term is equally applicable – actually more applicable – to buying and selling volatility.  In my opinion, that’s where all the opportunity is.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width500/568/buy-low-sell-high.png?mtime=20170829183934" alt="" /></figure><p>The price of an option is determined by six variables, five of which are known values based on pretty straightforward measures.  There’s no guesswork about them.  For example, the intrinsic value of an option is determined by the market price of the underlying.  It’s a very black and white measurement.  Nobody’s opinion is involved.  It’s pure mathematics, plain and simple.  That’s not the case with <a href="https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/learn/implied-volatility">implied volatility</a>.<br /></p>
<p>Implied volatility is the market’s estimate as to how much a stock is going to move – up or down – over a set period of time.  Sometimes the market gets it right.  Sometimes it doesn’t.  Sometimes it estimates implied volatility too high and sometimes it pegs it too low.  So, today, I’m going to walk you through a couple of trade setups you can use when implied volatility is higher than historical volatility.</p>
<p>In each setup I’m going to use <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/">GameStop Corp</a> (<strong>GME</strong>) as my example.  I’m going to show you how to trade volatility when you’re a bull and when you’re a bear.</p>
<h2>Step One – Should We Be Long Or Short?</h2>
<p>Take a look at the image below.  Here we’re looking at a graph comparing implied volatility (the red line) to <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/historicalvolatility.asp">historical volatility</a> (the blue line).  When I took this screenshot 30-day implied volatility was at 54.43 and historical volatility was at 23.27.  That’s huge!</p>
<p>
</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width500/Volatility-Trading-Week-1.png?mtime=20170829183129" alt="" /></figure><p>That’s the biggest mismatch we’ve seen in more than a year.  Since implied volatility is so out of whack with historical, I think that a trader has a better chance of winning by selling premium rather than buying it.  And, that’s the case whether the trader is a bull or a bear.  Let’s say you’re a bull.<br /></p>
<h2>The Bull Case – Trade Setup</h2>
<p>If you’re a bull and you want to make a directional trade to profit from an up move in the stock you have two choices.  You can go long calls (or a call spread) or you can short a <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">put spread</a>.  There’s no naked writing in my methodology.  And, as I suggested above, with implied volatility so high, I’d be awfully shy about going long.  There’s just too much risk of volatility shock.  So, I’m going to suggest that in this circumstance the upside move is a bull put spread.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/Volatility-Trading-Week-2.png?mtime=20170829183230" alt="" /></figure><p>Let’s look at what GME is offering the bulls.  The expected move is about 2.2 points and the stock is at 20.93.  That means the market thinks the stock could go to 23.13.  So, if I write a credit spread and GME moves as expected, both of the strikes I’ve chosen should expire worthless and I’ll max out my profits.  My credit spread is long the 21 strike and short the 22-half strike.<br /></p>
<p>That will generate 97-cents in premium.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/Volatility-Trading-Week-3.png?mtime=20170829183251" alt="" /></figure><p>Now let’s look at what the bears might expect.  I’m going to keep this simple and use the same strikes and follow the same logic, that there’s just too much risk being long premium with volatility so high.<br /></p>
<h2>The Bear Case – Trade Setup</h2>
<p>To make this call spread a credit spread – and therefore a bear spread – I’m going to sell the 21 and buy 22-half.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width800/Volatility-Trading-Week-4.png?mtime=20170829183349" alt="" /></figure><p>That’s going to bring in 56-cents of premium income.  Using the expected move of 2.2 points, the market is suggesting that on the downside GME could trade to 18.73.  So, being short the 21 strike is well within that move.  If the stock did trade there, then both options would expire worthless and I’d get to keep my 56-cents.<br /></p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/Volatility-Trading-Week-5.png?mtime=20170829183412" alt="" /></figure><h2>Volatility Trading Is Opportunity</h2>
<p>The examples above are some of the simplest ways to trade volatility.  There are plenty more strategies that a trader can use to take advantage of a mismatch between implied volatility and historical volatility.</p>
<p>Many of those strategies are pretty complex.  But, the best part about them is that you don’t need to make a bet one way or the other.  You don’t have to make a directional play for those other strategies to work out.  You can be completely neutral and still make profitable trades.</p>
<p>This is one of the main reasons that I believe that trading volatility is where all the opportunity is!</p>

      ><![CDATA[<p>Over the years I have learned that there is no upside to emotional trading. The market is random, and if you try to guess what the next tick will be you will lose. In this post I walk you through designing a trading strategy that prevents your emotions from sabotaging your trading through the wildest of times.</p>]]></summary>
                <description
      ><![CDATA[
                    
                      <p>If you follow my gospel you know I preach trading strategies that remove all <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/mechanical-vs-emotional-trading">emotion</a>. Let’s face it—the stock market is random, and accepting that randomness is the first step to becoming a profitable trader. No one can predict the next tick in the market. I believe you can predict the outcome of many trades in a row, but you can’t predict the outcome of any one trade. Attempting to trade a strategy that requires you to decide whether to enter and exit a trade <em>and</em> the size of the trade, it’s inevitable that your emotions will creep in. And, I submit, there is no upside to emotional trading—you are bound to slip up.<br /></p>
<h2>How to Prevent Emotional Trading</h2>
<p>The best way to prevent emotional trading is to choose strategies based on probabilities. For example, during the period from <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/how-often-the-spy-falls-more-than-5-in-a-30-day-period-and-why-you-should-care">1993 to 2014</a> I discovered that 11% of the time the S&amp;P 500 dropped more than 5% in any 30-day period. So why not design a trading strategy that profits if the S&amp;P 500 does not drop 5% in any 30-day period? I trade <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-so-special-about-option-credit-spreads">put credit spreads</a> on the SPY and I know, based on past performance, I will have winning trades 89% of the time.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/emotional-trading-of-options-500x535.jpg?mtime=20170901235017" alt="Emotional Trading" title="Emotional Trading" /></figure><p>I know what you are thinking: if the market is so random how can you rely on S&amp;P 500 statistics? A fundamental reason for this long-term trend is that the U.S. stock market is the primary place people invest money for long-term growth (think retirement funds). New money tends to flow into the market consistently because most people have X dollars taken out of their paycheck every month for retirement investing. It is a supply and demand dynamic—as long as new money flows in, the market should have a bias not to tank.<br /></p>
<p>Am I being emotional about the foundation of my own trading strategy (the S&amp;P 500 dropping over a 30-day period)? It’s true that I must apply some judgment to my strategy, and where there is judgement there is emotion. So I concede I can’t avoid emotional trading altogether, but I make a decision after hours of research and backtesting and I do not revisit the decision unless my strategy starts to fail. What I want is to avoid day-to-day, in-the-moment emotional trading decisions.  </p>
<h2>Check Your Emotions at the Door</h2>
<p>As I said, I trade put credit spreads on the SPY and I <em>expect</em> to lose money 11% of the time. And when trades go against me I lose money in a big way. In general on a one lot trade I make around $23 before commissions—but if the trade goes against me I can lose up to $177. Because I need 8 winning trades to make up for one loss, I need to place as many of these trades as possible to have a nice yearly return. I need to trust my trading strategy and place trades regardless of how scary the market is. Every so often the market tanks for good reason (think the 2001 tech crash or the 2008 real estate crash). During these times it’s tempting to sit on the sidelines, but my strategy obligates me to check my emotions at the door and continue to trade through wild times. And over time I have learned that wild times can be some of the best times to trade.</p>
<p>When I design a trading strategy I make sure it does not rely on emotional trading. I base my strategy on a foundation validated through backtesting. Then I execute my strategy over and over like a robot. Sometimes I even try to automate it. Because my trading decisions require no in-the-moment judgement there is no room for emotions to skew my returns.</p>

      ><![CDATA[<p>Short straddles present an opportunity to make a profit whenever a stock appears stuck in a neutral price zone. This option strategy generates extra income by selling double the usual number of contracts. While the profitability is capped at the amount of premiums received, the potential loss is unlimited.</p>]]></summary>
                <description
      ><![CDATA[
                    
                      <p>When a stock appears to be in a range-bound phase, with little expectation that the price will undergo any significant movement, a short straddle may be a wise investment. The maximum profit from this strategy is quite limited; it is just the premiums collected minus commissions. At the same time, the maximum loss is unlimited if the underlying stock goes up. The strategy could also create a significant loss if the stock goes down substantially.</p>
<h2>Taking a Short Straddle Position</h2>
<p>To make a short straddle position, you sell one uncovered call option and one uncovered put option. The contracts must have the same underlying stock, expiration date, and strike price. Of course, you can write more than two options. Just be sure that the number of puts equals the number of calls. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width1000/short-straddles-risk-graph.jpg?mtime=20170824183021" alt="Short Straddles Graph" title="Short Straddles Graph" /></figure><p><br /></p>
<p>By writing two contracts instead of one, you collect two premiums. Taking a double position creates greater sensitivity to time decay than single options. The short straddle will be more profitable if time passes while the stock has little price action. These are the primary advantages of the strategy. There are significant downsides. </p>
<h2>Risks Associated With Short Straddles </h2>
<p>The ideal situation is for the stock price to reach the strike price at expiration. This is where the maximum profit would be achieved, and no contracts are assigned. If a contract is in the money by a penny or more, it will automatically be exercised on the expiration date. </p>
<p>If the equity price is higher than the strike price, the call option will be assigned, and you’ll have to first buy the stock in the market and then sell it at the strike price to the counterparty. On the other hand, if the stock price is lower, the put option will be assigned. This will force you to buy shares of the underlying stock at a higher price than what they are selling for on the open market. </p>
<h2>Short Straddle Example</h2>
<p>Suppose you expect Wal-Mart to have neutral price action in the next few months. You sell one call option for $1 and one put option for $3. Both have a strike price of $80 and the same expiration date. The most you can make on the trade is $4 minus any commissions you paid for the trade. If you want to make more money, just sell more contracts, keeping the number of puts equal to the number of calls. In this case, 10 contracts on both sides would generate $4,000 of revenue (10 contracts per side × 100 shares per contract × $4 credit), not taking into account trading fees. The further the price of the underlying equity moves from the strike price, the more money is lost on the investment.</p>
<h2>Short Straddle Equations</h2>
<p>Scrutinizing the numbers in the above example will reveal the following break-even equations:</p>
<blockquote>Break-even point (above the strike) = strike price + premiums earned - commissions</blockquote>
<blockquote>Break-even point (below the strike) = strike price - premiums earned + commissions</blockquote>
<p>Using the numbers from the Wal-Mart example produces a trading range of $84 to $76. You need the stock price to stay in this range. If it breaks out, you will begin to lose money. You could hold until expiration, hoping the stock re-enters the break-even range and you don’t get an early assignment. Or you could cut your losses by buying option contracts to offset the ones you wrote. Doing so would take you out of the position. </p>
<p>A potential loss can be estimated using these equations:</p>
<blockquote>Loss (if stock is above strike price) = Premiums collected – commissions + strike price – stock price</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loss (if stock is below strike price) = Premiums collected – commissions + stock price – strike price</blockquote>
<p>Because of the high risk and low return potential of the short straddle position, it is recommended only for experienced traders. </p>

Let’s go over some of the many types of options and their key differences.</p>]]></summary>
                <description
      ><![CDATA[
                    
                      <p>There are many different types of options. Options are “derivatives”, which simply means that their value is derived from another asset. Consider stock-based options, they derive their value from the stocks that they are based on. In general, derivatives can be based on a huge range of assets.  This is true of options as well.</p>
<h2>Different Types Of Options Explained</h2>
<p>While many options are tied to stocks, options can also be based on a huge range of different assets. We’re going to go over these different types of options, and will also highlight some other types of options, such as binary options and the difference between European and American options. We’re going to highlight some of the most common assets, but don’t think of this list as exhaustive.<br /><br /></p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/the-different-types-of-options.png?mtime=20170822100547" alt="" /></figure><h2>Equity (stock) Based Options</h2>
<p>Equity Options are the most common and popular type of option. Equity options are based on underlying stocks. When you buy a call equity option, you gain the right but not obligation to buy stocks at a certain price. When you buy a put option, you gain the right to sell. </p>
<p>Equity options are sold in lots of 100, meaning you gain the right to buy or sell 100 stocks. You don’t have to actually own the stocks in question. You can simply buy the options. This is true for both put and call options. When you do own the underlying stock and also buy put options, that’s actually called a “married put”. </p>
<h2>Stock Index</h2>
<p>Besides individual stocks, you can also buy options based on a stock index. A stock index is an indicator comprised of numerous different stocks. Usually, stock indexes are created so that traders and economists may quickly and easily monitor the overall market. </p>
<p>For example, the S&amp;P 500 is made up of 500 of the largest publically traded companies in the United States. These companies are spread across a wide range of industries. As such, the S&amp;P 500 provides a good indicator of how markets are doing in general.</p>
<p>You can buy options that are tied to the point value assigned to each index. This way, you can “bet” on which way markets will move. Will markets rise, or will they fall? Many options traders like index-based options because they can focus on macro-trends rather than individual company performance.</p>
<h2>Commodities Options</h2>
<p>Options can also be tied to commodities. What is a commodity? A commodity is a basic good that is interchangeable with other basic goods of the same time. Consider barrels of Brent Crude Oil. Each barrel of Brent Crude is equal in value to another barrel of Brent Crude. However, West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil (WTI) is a different type of oil, and so a barrel of WTI will not necessarily be of the same value as Brent. In fact, WTI is normally a bit cheaper.</p>
<p>Commodities are most commonly traded through “futures” contracts. Like an option, a futures contract is a derivative. Futures also feature an expiration date. Unlike options, however, when you buy a future, you are obligated to buy the asset and the seller is obligated to sell. Let’s say you purchase a future for one barrel of Brent Crude oil in May of 2018 for $50 dollars. Come May, you will be obligated to buy that barrel of oil for $50.</p>
<p>Options based commodities are generally based on futures, making them derivatives of derivatives. You could buy an option based on the futures contract for Brent Crude oil come May of 2018. Unlike a future, you wouldn’t be obligated to buy the barrel of crude, but you would have the option to do so.</p>
<h2>Foreign Exchange Options</h2>
<p>Do you know what the biggest financial market in the world is? If you’re thinking the New York Stock Exchange, or even stocks in general, you’re wrong. The biggest market is actually the Foreign Exchange, or FOREX markets. These markets run 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and are the largest, most liquid markets in the world. </p>
<p>Forex markets are the global currency exchange markets that allow governments, companies, and other entities to quickly and easily convert currencies. You can buy options based on Forex markets. With these options, you will have the right but not obligation to exchange one currency at a specified rate with another currency at a future point in time.</p>
<h2>A Quick Look At Binary Options</h2>
<p>With so many different types of options one we can not ignore is called “binary” options. These options are gaining some popularity in Europe, but aren’t as commonly traded in the United States or by Americans in general. They offer a simple “yes” and “no” proposition. With binary options,  you simply state “yes” or “no” regarding whether an asset will rise above a certain price. Binary options are often set up to expire in mere minutes or even seconds. </p>
<p>So let’s say you by a binary option for Acme Motors, which is currently trading at $25.50. There’s a yes or no binary option that expires in five minutes with a strike price of $25.55. In this case you can either vote “yes” or “no” that the stock price will be at or above $25.55. If you vote no, and stock prices rise to $25.54, or any price below $25.55, you’ll earn a predetermined pay, which is usually expressed as a percent. Get it wrong, and you’ll lose whatever you invested.</p>
<h2>American Options Versus European Options</h2>
<p>On a final note, you may sometimes hear traders talking about “American options” and “European options.” This doesn’t have anything to do with the underlying assets. European stocks can still be the underlying asset for American options, and vice versa. The difference instead comes down to the setup of the option contract itself, and it’s a very important difference. </p>
<p>With American options, you can exercise your option at any point before the expiration date. With European options, you can only exercise the options at the moment they expire. In other words, if you buy a call option for Apple Inc. stock, with an American option you can buy those Apple stocks at any point before the option expires. With a European option, you only have one chance to buy the Apple stock, and that’s at the exact moment the options expire. This makes American options much more flexible, and as a result, most traders prefer to trade with them. </p>

                      <p>If you have ever traded options before, you’ve likely seen a numerical value for "delta" on your trading platform. Delta is simply one of several values options traders refer to as "<a href="https://www.optionsplaybook.com/options-introduction/option-greeks/">greeks</a>". These numbers are all being used in calculations behind the scenes to determine what the fair premium for an option contract is. Other greeks include <a href="https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/learn/theta">Theta</a> and <a href="http://www.theoptionsguide.com/gamma.aspx">Gamma</a>, but today we will be considering delta and how you can profit from it.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width1000/delta-gamma-theta-vega.png?mtime=20170817203658" alt="Long Delta Strategies" title="Long Delta Strategies" /></figure><p><br /></p>
<p>So, we know delta is a number, and we know that delta corresponds to an options price, but how? Put simply, delta is a ratio. The delta ratio represents how the price of an option will change for every $1 the stock moves . This can be confusing to think about, so let's use an example. Let’s say I purchase a call option on stock ABC. This call option has a delta of 40. If stock ABC moves $1 higher, my call option will gain $40 in value. Similarly, if stock ABC moves down $1 tomorrow, my call option will lose $40 in value. </p>
<p>Options can have a negative delta as well. Put options always have a negative delta, because they gain value when a stock moves downwards. Call options always have a positive delta, because they become more valuable when a stock moves upwards. However, Delta does have a cap. A single call option can have a delta value ranging from 0-100. A put option can have a delta value ranging from -100 to 0.  This makes a lot of sense when  considering options correspond with 100 shares of underlying stock. Options that are in the money will have a delta closer to 100 or -100. Options that are out of the money have a lower delta value closer to 0. Now that we understand the mechanics of delta, let’s examine how to make profitable trades by using delta as our main vehicle. </p>
<h2>Long Delta Strategies vs Other Strategies</h2>
<p>Because delta is associated with the direction of a stock's movement, we will look to use delta to profit when we have a strong opinion that a stock will move up or down. This is also called directional trading. A large majority of options traders tend to stray away from directional trading, and instead opt to make most of their money by selling options to collect cash. They then wait for the options they sold to expire worthless, or buy the options back for a lower price. These are called long theta strategies. Good examples of long theta strategies are short put spreads, and iron condors. These strategies usually have a higher probability of being profitable. For what reasons would we want to enter a trade that has a lower chance of being profitable? Certain long delta strategies, such as the long call spread, have notable benefits over long theta strategies.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Long Call Spreads</h2>
<p>One benefit of long call spreads (aka: long delta strategies) that will be attractive to many new options traders is that it is a much cheaper position to enter than a short put spread. These are both bullish positions that will benefit when the stock rises in value. However, the long call spread will tie up much less of your buying power, and additionally generate more profit from a directional move. Let’s use a real world world example to demonstrate.</p>
<p>American Airlines, stock ticker <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAL/">AAL</a>, reported their earnings after hours this past Friday. Imagine that I am a bullish on AAL this earnings, I think they will surpass expectations and the stock price will rise. A common strategy would be to sell a put spread. The stock is currently trading at $50.49, so I’ll choose some options near the current price. Imagine I sell a 48/50 put spread expiring in two weeks. By all means, this is a decent trade. It has a 60% probability of profit, I’ll collect a 32$ premium, and the stock can stay flat or even go down a bit and I’ll still make money. It has a delta of about 21. The real downside here is that if the stock really trades downwards, my maximum loss is  $168. For a new trader with not much capital to work with, that risk/reward profile can be pretty unacceptable. Let’s examine the alternative, a long call spread. I’ll choose similar strikes, a 50/52 call spread, with the same expiry. This trade has a lower probability of profit at 45%, but let's examine the risk/reward profile. The delta is 27, so more money will be made if our directional prediction is correct. We pay an $81 debt, so that is our max loss. The maximum profit on this position is 119$, larger than the maximum profit of the put spread, while boasting a much lower maximum loss as well. So, what's the downside? When trading a short put spread, the stock can go up, flat, or even down a little bit and we can still collect our max profit. The main mechanism of profit in a put spread is typically time decay. With the long call spread, the stock <em>must</em> go up for us to realize our maximum profit. This is why I personally love trading long call spreads around binary events, such as earnings. It puts less money on the line while still giving us a high payout in the event that our prediction is correct. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width1000/long-delta-strategies.jpg?mtime=20170817204228" alt="Long Delta Strategies" title="Long Delta Strategies" /></figure><p><br /></p>
<p>Another great use of long call spreads is simulating stock positions. Many new investors want to long a stock, but do not have the capital required to make a profit that is worth the investment. If I want to buy 100 shares of a 100$ stock, it would require me to invest 1,000$ in cash. That ties up a lot of buying power, and in small accounts this can lead to less diversified risk. Alternatively, one could buy a call spread that has a delta of 100. An options position with a delta of 100 will act almost exactly the same as purchasing 100 shares, but will require a much smaller initial debt, enabling those with smaller accounts to spread their capital into multiple positions. The main downside with going long a stock with this strategy is that your initial debt will disappear much faster in the event the stock moves against you. On top of this, you will be forfeiting any dividend you would receive if you had held the stock. Options positions also expire, where as stock can be held forever. This creates a limit on the amount of time you can go long on the stock. Finally, long call spreads have a maximum profit whereas stock positions have unlimited profit.</p>
<p>Many options traders will try to avoid long delta strategies in favor of more time tested strategies. Overall, I suggest all traders do their own research, and learn what ways long delta strategies can benefit your portfolio before ignoring them entirely.</p>

                <description
      ><![CDATA[
                    
                      <p>Iron condor. That might sound like a term that belongs in a World War II documentary, but it’s actually a very effective options trading strategy. With an <strong>iron condor</strong>, you utilize four different options contracts, or legs, to profit off of relatively <em>stable</em> stock prices. This is a bit different from most investment strategies, which typically rely on asset prices moving up or down. For investors, however, the ability to generate returns off of stable markets, or sideways prices movements as they are often called, adds yet another tool to the investing tool box.</p>
<h2>The Risks &amp; Benefits of the Iron Condor Explained</h2>
<p>As with all investments, there are risks with the iron condor trading strategy. When you break down the probabilities, there is a high probability of the iron condor being profitable when markets are trending flat. However, you will have to risk a relatively large amount of money in order to secure a comparatively small profit. Before making any investments, it’s important to understand the risk profiles of that investment.</p>
<p>That being said, the iron condor trading strategy is relatively easy to implement and the chance of producing a profit can be relatively high. Iron condors are "credit" options, which means you will be paid money up front. However, you are exposed to long-term risks and could have to pay out more money than what you put it (more on that later). So how does iron condor work? Lets explain.</p>
<h2>The Nuts &amp; Bolts of Iron Condor Explained</h2>
<p>An iron condor uses two vertical spreads for more on vertical spreads <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">CLICK HERE</a>, and four options contracts with four different strike prices. Let’s use a fictional stock, ACME Computers to illustrate. And let’s assume that ACME is currently trading for $43 dollars a share at the beginning of September. You believe stock prices are going to remain stable over the next several weeks, and so you decide to set up an iron condor to profit off of that stability.</p>
<p>You are going to set up two vertical spreads.  First, you are going to create a put spread by selling a put option, and then buying another put option with a lower strike price. Next, you are going to create a call spread by selling a call option, and buying another call at a higher strike price. This will create the four legs needed to set up an <strong>iron condor</strong>. With most brokers you can place both legs of this trade at the same time.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width1000/iron-condor-explained.jpg?mtime=20170727160801" alt="Iron Condor Explained" title="Iron Condor Explained" /><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Remember, ACME is currently trading for $43. Let’s say you sell a put at $45 and buy another put at $40. Then you sell  a call at $50 and buy a call at $55. You’re making these trades in early September with an expiration date in October (meaning, the Saturday following the third Friday of October). Thus, you have four legs to your Iron Condor as such (numbers fictionalized):</p>
<p>Buy 10 ACME Oct $55 calls at $.50</p>
<p>Sell 10 ACME Oct $50 calls at $ 1</p>
<p>Sell 10 ACME Oct $45 puts at $1</p>
<p>Buy 10 ACME Oct $40 puts $ .50</p>
<p>So what does that mean in actual numbers? Let’s break it down.</p>
<h2>Breaking Down an Iron Condor Trade</h2>
<p>Keep in mind that options are bought and sold in batches of 100, meaning one option represents 100 share of the underlying asset. First, you sell 10 ACME $50 calls at $1 a stock, getting $1000 dollars. Then you buy 10 ACME $55 calls at $0.50 cents a share, thus giving you a credit of $500 dollars. You do the same with the put options; sell 10 ACME $45 puts at $1.00, and buy 10 ACME $40 puts at $0.50. Between the calls and puts, you end up with with a $1,000  credit (meaning $1,000 cash in your account). Ideally, ACME will stay somewhere between $45 and $50. If this happens, the options all expire worthless, and you get to keep the full $1,000 credit. This is your maximum profit potential. </p>
<p>Your maximum losses are determined by the differences in strike prices, which in this case is $5. At a maximum, you could be on the hook for $5 x the total number of shares, which in this case is 1,000 (10 option contracts @ 100 shares per contract). This means your total risk is $5,000. Risks won’t exceed this because the options you bought (versus sold) will cover any losses that would exceed it.  So, if ACME jumps to $60 dollars, you’d exercise your call options to buy ACME at $55 per share. Likewise, if ACME fell to $35 dollars, you’d exercise your put options to sell the shares at $40. </p>
<p>In this way, the iron condor limits your exposure. However, it’s important to remember that you are risking up to $5,000 dollars in order to secure a profit of $1,000. On top of this, you will also have to pay commissions for each contract, which must then be added to your losses, or subtracted from your gains. Still, when markets are stable, the iron condor offers a great way to produce profits off of that stability.</p>

      ><![CDATA[
                    
                      <p>
If you’ve been trading put and call options because you’re bullish or bearish on a particular stock, you’re only capturing part of the market. There will be times when there’s too much uncertainty around a company to know where its stock is headed. Maybe there’s a big news announcement around the corner, or the latest quarterly earnings are soon to be released. But the exact details are unknown. In these types of scenarios, a put or call option isn’t the best course of action, nor is going long or short on the underlying stock.
</p>
<p>That’s where an option straddle comes in and allows you to profit using long straddles. This strategy is profitable whenever there is a significant movement in the underlying stock’s price, either up or down. The direction doesn’t matter, so you don’t have to take a bullish or bearish stance on the company. But the stock’s price has to move significantly; otherwise, the straddle won’t make a dime.</p>
<h2>Placing a Long Straddle Trade</h2>
<p>To create a long straddle position, you buy one put option and one call option, both of which have the same expiration date and strike price. By purchasing a call and a put together, the maximum loss is limited, while the maximum profit is unlimited. Because of this, straddles are an attractive strategy to include in any derivative investment plan.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width1000/Profit-Using-Long-Straddles.png?mtime=20170726184851" alt="Profit Using Long Straddles" title="Profit Using Long Straddles" /><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Of course, you can purchase multiple calls and puts simultaneously. The straddle position requires that the number of calls equal the number of puts.</p>
<h2>Example of a Profiting Using Long Straddles</h2>
<p>As an example, say you want to enter a long straddle position in IBM. The stock is trading at $145. You buy a call option with a strike price of $143 for $4 and a put option with the same strike price and expiration date at $1. The total premium is $5. If the price of IBM moves sufficiently to cause one of the contracts to increase enough to outweigh the cost of the contracts (the premiums plus whatever you paid in commissions), the trade will be successful. But the stock price has to move enough for that to happen.</p>
<p>If IBM hovers around $145, the straddle investment will be a loss, capped at the total amount paid in premiums and commissions. If the price of the equity ends at the strike price at expiration, the greatest possible loss will be achieved.</p>
<h2>Straddle Equations</h2>
<p>If you play with the numbers in the above example, you will discover the following break-even equations, which reveal how far the stock price needs to move so that you don’t lose any money on the trade.</p>
<blockquote><strong>Upper break-even price</strong> = Strike price + total premiums and commissions paid</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Lower break-even price</strong> = Strike price – total premiums and commissions paid</blockquote>
<p>Using these equations, we can determine the break-even points for the IBM straddle trade. Assuming you paid nothing in commissions, the range of no profit would be $148 to $138. If the stock breaks out of that range, you will begin to make money.</p>
<p>Analyzing the numbers in the example also reveals the equations for profit.</p>
<blockquote><strong>Profit (above the range)</strong> = Stock price – strike price – total premiums and commissions paid</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Profit (below the range)</strong> = Strike price – stock price – total premiums and commissions paid</blockquote>
<p>Although volatility is often spoken of in the financial press as undesirable, long straddles are one case where you can profit from it. If you foresee major price swings in the near future, break out your straddles playbook.</p>

                      <p>Say hello to Options Cafe! As the Founder and CEO of Stockpeer, and a tenured software developer, I am excited to announce that the Stockpeer.com blog is retiring and <a href="https://options.cafe">Options.Cafe</a> is taking over. When I registered <a href="https://stockpeer.com/">Stockpeer.com</a> nearly 10 years ago, I had a much different vision. While I was trading options, at the time, stocks were my passion. Fast forward to today, and options have become the bulk of my trading activity.<br /></p>
                    
                      <h2>New Name New Vision</h2>
                    
                      <p>When I registered <a href="https://stockpeer.com">Stockpeer.com</a> nearly 10 years ago, I had a much different vision. While I was trading options, at the time, stocks were my passion. Fast forward to today, and options have become the bulk of my trading activity. With the fluctuating state of the global marketplace, this is the route many self-investors are taking.</p>
<p>Why? Because when leveraged properly, options have <em>higher </em>returns, <em>less</em> risk, and are <em>far more</em> predictable. A far more strategic method of investing your hard-earned money!</p>
                    
                      <h2>More Than Just A New Name</h2>
                    
                      <p>Our new name doesn’t just reflect our passion for options, but something far more exciting! For the last several months the Options Cafe Team has been tucked away working on something special. We have been building innovative new options trading software. Lots of it. </p>
<p>It’s not just software, but an entire trading platform dedicated solely to options. This is the same options trading software I’ve been using for my personal trading for the last 5 years — rebuilt to serve the masses.</p>

</p>
                    
                      <h2>Graduating From Blog To Software Company</h2>
                    
                      <p>What most trading software brokers provide is too generic. The software tries to be all things to all people. As you well may know, this approach doesn’t work.</p>
                    
                      <p>Options Cafe decided to take an entirely different approach: <em>to excel in one area of trading—options only</em>. Built to accommodate advanced multi-leg trades (think put credit spreads, or iron condors) our software stands out from the crowd. Options Cafe primary area of focus will be:<br /></p>
<ul><li><p>An easy and efficient way to display the status of your options. We combine your multi-leg options into <em>one </em>trade strategy, making it easier to manage and monitor. </p></li></ul><ul><li><p>A robust screener. Stop spending hours searching for quality trades. Input your strategies and goals into our options trading software, and options that fit your criteria will populate.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Finally, custom reporting just for options traders. Ever wonder how long your credit spreads take to close on average? Option Cafe can tell you. Do you find tracking account performance to be tough when you're constantly depositing new money into your account or taking cash out to live? We’ve got you covered. </p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Don’t trade blind. Assess how well your current and previous strategies have performed, and build entirely new strategies with our options backtesting tool. Test run your strategy day-by-day as if you were there placing the trades. You can even view how would your strategy have performed over a designated time frame—going back 10 years or more.</p></li></ul><p>Options Cafe will not be a broker; we communicate with brokers on your behalf. Our soft launch is targeted for fall of 2017, with the launch of <a href="https://brokerage.tradier.com/?utm_campaign=options.cafe">Tradier</a> (one of our favorite brokers for options trading). We aim to add additional brokers shortly thereafter.  </p>
<p>We hope you are excited as we are for our transition from trading blog to options trading software. I can’t wait to share Options Cafe with everyone.</p>
<p>Keep Trading,</p>

                      <p>I like directional trading—heck, I even <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/29/how-i-day-trade-the-spy">blog</a> about it from time to time—but for the most part directional options trading is a hobby, something I do for fun with my FU money. There is nothing better than picking a direction, applying a leveraged bet via options or futures, and watching that trade take off. I have risked $300 in the morning and closed the day with $2000; that’s a pretty big high. And when that happens, like a drug addict chasing a high each morning you wake up thinking you can turn $300 into $2000 again. Directional trading is exciting and can earn you a few bucks, but it very rarely turns into a long-term income-producing strategy. </p>
                    
                      <p>

                      <h2>Isn’t All Options Trading Directional?</h2>
                    
                      <p>In my opinion directional options trading can be useful, but more on that later. Let’s first look at the type of trades I prefer. I seek statistical and probability-based trades, such as my <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/baseline-strategy-for-trading-spy-put-credit-spreads">Baseline Strategy</a>. I want to deploy trading strategies that do not require me to form an opinion on anything. My trades are based on the statistical chances that I will profit. For example:</p>
<p><em>During any 30-day period from 1993 through 2014 the SPY (the Exchange Traded Funds, or ETFs, tracking the S&amp;P 500) closed down 5% or more 11% of the time</em></p>
<p>Did you know that? Based on this simple fact I can build strategies that focus on profiting when the SPY does anything other than drop 5%. That is, the SPY dropping 4%, rising 10%, or staying flat all lead to profit. I know, based on past performance, that 89% of the time I will profit and 11% of the time I will lose money. I tend to trade options using <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/what-is-so-special-about-option-credit-spreads">credit spreads </a>in order to take advantage of this statistical aspect of the market.<em><br /></em></p>
<p>This example is just one of tons of statistical opportunities in the market where options are an amazing tool for profit. I want to highlight the fact that my trading strategy is not based on news events, earnings reports, and the like. In the context of my statistical based trading strategy I simply do not care about what the market will do going forward. I have no directional bias.</p>
                    
                      <h2>When Is Directional Options Trading a Good Idea?</h2>
                    
                      <p>Just remember, these are one man’s thoughts. Tons of people do very well with directional trading. I submit, however, that these people have stressful lives and rarely see consistent (well, <em>more</em> consistent) returns. Typically only a select few survive—many directional trades go bust. But as I said, I do think there is value in directional trading. Though I tend to think directional trading should be done with small amounts of money (except in the case of buy and hold). Here are some cases when directional trading is a good idea:</p>
                    
                      <ul>
    <li>
        To stay in engaged. At times I like to day trade the S&amp;P 500 either through SPY options or ES futures contracts. Though I do have a strategy that is back tested, at the end of the day I am just making educated guesses about market direction based on signals I find useful. My core strategies are pretty boring day in, day out so I do some directional trading to stay excited, keep my juices flowing. 
      </li>
    <li>
        To hedge. Recently I thought the market might take a turn for the worse, having gotten over the Trump Bump. So I used a small amount of money to purchase some VXX calls, betting that volatility would increase fast (which typically happens when the market tanks). In the SPY example earlier 11% of the time a trader should expect to lose money, and I was guessing this might be one of those times so I tried to hedge my losses. I don’t do much hedging, but when I do I often use a directional trade.
      </li>
    <li>
        To buy and hold. Mainly done with stock, in the buy and hold arena I subscribe to the Warren Buffett way of thinking. If you buy good companies, sometime in the future they will be worth more. So buy and hold a long-term directional investment.
      </li>
  </ul>
                    
                      <h2>Options Trading Has Changed Everything</h2>
                    
                      <p>If non-directional trading is so smart why has directional trading been the core strategy on Wall Street for generations? Options products expanded just 10 years ago—once upon a time major indexes only offered monthly options. These days we have weekly options on almost every stock, ETF, and futures contract traded. Also, technology allows us to easily find statistical opportunities in the market along with the trades to take advantage of them. Lastly, high-frequency trading has created enough liquidity for our trades to get filled at profitable returns (perhaps more on that in a later blog post).  </p>
<p>Directional trading is not the only way to make money in the market using options. I encourage all directional traders to spend sometime looking at statistical based options trading strategies.</p>

                      <p>Have you ever wondered how your options trading strategy would perform over time? I have, so I built a <a href="https://stockpeer.com/backtest">backtester</a>. I wanted a way to simulate trading the options market day to day to see how well my strategies would have fared. Until now I have kept this backtester to myself, but today I am happy to introduce the Stockpeer backtester to the world. You can play with it by visiting <a href="https://stockpeer.com/backtest">https://stockpeer.com/backtest</a>.</p>
<p>Full disclosure: the backtester is far from complete. Consider this a super early alpha launch. I am offering only the ability to backtest the SPY, using put credit spreads, on end-of-day data. Want to see more options? More features? Share the love. Let me and others know you think the Stockpeer backtester is a cool tool by <a href="https://twitter.com/stockpeer">tweeting</a> about it or sharing it on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/stockpeer">Facebook</a>. Why? Because a good backtester is cumbersome and expensive to build, but your support and feedback will motivate me to continue making progress.</p>
                    
                      <h2>Backtester Goals</h2>
                    
                      <p>Although backtesting an investment strategy is not a new concept, the options world seems to lack good backtesting tools. My goal was to build something simple yet robust. Something that does not require the user to be a computer programmer. A backtester that allows you to test different strategies quickly just by pointing and clicking.</p>
                    
                      <p>

  </a>  
</p>
                    
                      <p>Most important, I aspire to build something that helps others learn and contributes to the conversation about options trading. Real data with real results eliminates subjective thinking and promotes objective thinking.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://stockpeer.com/backtest">Stockpeer backtester</a> is still in development, but I believe there is value in sharing earlier rather than later. I invite you to play with the backtester, share your results with others, and pass along any feedback you might have. Enjoy!</p>

                      <p>When I first started <a href="https://stockpeer.com/">Stockpeer</a> I expected to mostly share my experiences trading the stock market via automation. But I find myself talking less about automation for an important reason: automation can lead to a lack of engagement—aka complacency. No trader has ever gotten rich by being complacent.</p>
<p>I have written thousands of lines of code to backtest and automate different trading strategies. For awhile I was running software that fully automated my <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/5/the-only-free-lunch-in-trading-is-a-consistent-strategy">consistent</a> put credit spread <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/25/baseline-strategy-for-trading-spy-put-credit-spreads">strategy</a>. At the end of each day I noted which trades were made and checked for errors in my code, but that was it. I was not looking at charts or reading financial news. I was just watching the software do its thing. But the disconnect from the market was, I felt, bringing my personal growth to a standstill. So about a year ago I started to trade by hand again.</p>
                    
                      <h2>Trading Options by Hand vs. Automation</h2>
                    
                      <p>Don’t get the wrong idea—I did not give up on using my code to screen for trades; I just instructed the software not to place the trades automatically. Each day I reviewed a list of possible trades and decided whether to place them or not, thereby injecting some human intelligence and emotion to the final decision-making process. I was hoping to gain some edge by being more engaged in the market. I figured I would know better than a computer when to double down and when to sit on the sidelines. My mixed results the past year tell a different story.</p>
                    
                      <p>
    <a href="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/engagment.png?mtime=20170514144519">
      <img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width1000/engagment.png?mtime=20170514144519" style="width: 100%; float: none; display: block; margin: 0px auto;" alt="Engagment" />
  </a>  
</p>
                    
                      <p>In auto mode my strategy was applied regardless of the headlines, but the human-powered version of my strategy formed opinions. When it was time to double down I did pretty well, placing multiple trades at the best possible times and besting my automated strategy, which would have placed only one. But I underperformed when it was time to sit on the sidelines. In fact, I discovered that my strategy does not want me on the sidelines at all. In the past year I often did not place trades when I should have because I believed the future held a better opportunity that hinged on some world event I knew was coming up. Therein lies the primary difference: automation does not care about tomorrow. Automation places trades based on the here and now. Sort of like a financial Buddha. (Is that an oxymoron?)  </p>
                    
                      <h2>And the Winner Is?</h2>
                    
                      <p>Automation. Fact: had I run my automation software the past year I would have had better returns. So what should I do with this information? If I go back to automation, can I find a way to remain engaged? Can I can modify my hand trading approach to better match the automated strategy?</p>
<p>I am taking a hybrid approach. I will restart automation because I feel strongly that humans and emotion have no place in trading decisions. The black-or-white filter the computer applies to decision-making imparts a strong edge. As for staying engaged, I might go deeper into my <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/29/how-i-day-trade-the-spy">day trading of the SPY </a>and spend more time on my futures trading strategy <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/42/trading-futures-as-a-hedge">Trading Futures as a Hedge</a>.</p>
<p>To summarize: Computers are good at trading—humans not so much. But humans program computers so humans must stay engaged and growing to keep the fresh ideas flowing.</p>

                      <p>Recently I have been playing around with something new: trading the futures market as a hedge against <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/5/the-only-free-lunch-in-trading-is-a-consistent-strategy">my options trading strategy</a>. Why hedge a good bet you ask? Though the <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/40/trading-weekly-put-credit-spreads">strategy</a> I rely on the most—trading <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/11/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">put credit spreads</a> on a consistent basis—is pretty reliable, it does occasionally break down, causing a big drawdown in capital. In 2015, for example, I earned profit every month except August and September. The market pulled back hard and fast during those 2 months, and major drawdowns ensued. Had it not been for those losses I would have ended the year with a gain of nearly 90%. But that’s not what happened, and I ended the year with a low double-digit return. This experience sent me searching for a way to protect against such blows.</p>
                    
                      <h2>Hello Futures Trading!</h2>
                    
                      <p>Buckle up because the futures market is the Wild West. If you’re not careful you can lose all your capital in the blink of an eye—or in that same blink your wealth can blow up. The futures market is by design highly leveraged. For instance, $500 in down payment (margin requirement) can give you access to around $100,000 in the case of the <a href="http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/e-mini-sandp500.html">ES</a> (S&amp;P 500 index). A $0.25 move in the S&amp;P 500 (future) is equal to $12.50. Translation: massive leverage.</p>
                    
                      <p>
    <a href="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/futures-trading.jpg?mtime=20170514144555">
      <img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width1000/futures-trading.jpg?mtime=20170514144555" style="width: 75%; float: none; display: block; margin: 0px auto;" alt="Futures-Trading" />
  </a>  
</p>
                    
                      <p>What’s more, most futures brokers are stuck in the 1990s; the trading software stinks. Transferring money in and out of your account is painful and too often there are no safeguards to stop you from doing something dumb (like buying a future when you don’t have proper money—yeah, that crazy!).</p>
<p>The futures market is for experienced investors and people willing to put in the time to learn the ins and outs. Rubes and slackers beware.</p>
                    
                      <h2>How Futures Can Hedge You</h2>
                    
                      <p>Options are already a highly leveraged investment vehicle, so to hedge against an option’s position you need something even more leveraged to ensure that the cost of your hedge does not cut into your profits too much. That’s why futures are a great place to look for hedging opportunities. </p>
<p>I am still in the experimental mode, but when I am more confident I will share the lowdown on how I am hedging my options trading. For now, just the highlights. I created an algorithm to trade the S&amp;P 500 index (ES) that produces about what I expect to lose in options trading each year. Meaning this algorithm should offset any losses I experience in options trades. The good news is this algorithm uses about 10% of my planned capital. That is, I can set aside 10% and run it through this algorithm to protect against all of my projected losses.</p>
<p>The other great thing about the algorithm is its tendency to perform well when my options are failing and remain relatively flat when my options are profitable. Did you get that? It kicks in when times are bad and chills out when times are good. I have been running this algorithm only for some weeks, but I have backtested it to 2009 (it’s the backtesting results I am referring to, which is one reason I am not ready to share the nuts and bolts of this approach).</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is that I am more or less day trading futures. I find times in the market that seem oversold or overbought and I place a trade assuming the market will revert back to the mean. Through backtesting I can identify conditions with a high probability of being right for placing bets. Given how wild futures markets are I highly recommend automating your strategy. Lots of brokers have tools that allow you to create an algorithm and write some basic software code to instruct the system to autotrade for you. My pick is <a href="http://ninjatrader.com/">NinjaTrader</a>. Yes, a computer programming background is helpful, but if you are willing to learn writing an algorithm doesn’t take much. [You don’t need a computer science degree, trust me.] Other tools are more of the point-and-click ilk. My point is this: I do not recommend trading futures by hand unless your strategy is so optimized.</p>
                    
                      <h2>Just a Tease</h2>
                    
                      <p>I am still kicking the tires of this idea of trading futures to hedge my options trading. But I am logging the hours to figure this thing out and I intend to share my discoveries. I also want to start a conversation so if anyone out there wants to collaborate on this endeavor drop me a line.</p>

                      <p>To start I want to point out 2 things: this idea is not originally mine, and though I talk mostly about trading I think the concept applies to all forms of investing (buy-and-hold, real estate, fixed income, and so on). From time to time I attend a meetup group called <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Options-for-Income/">Options for Income</a> in the Portland area, and the tactic I am about to describe comes from Mike, the group leader.</p>
                    
                      <p>
    <a href="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/rpc_jpeg_48.jpg?mtime=20170514145008">
      <img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width1000/rpc_jpeg_48.jpg?mtime=20170514145008" style="width: 50%; float: none; display: block; margin: 0px auto;" alt="Rpc_Jpeg_48" />
  </a>  
</p>
                    
                      <p>I have been trading and investing for over a decade now, and though I have always reviewed my trades I never graded them. Until now. Recently I went a step further and started assigning grades to my trades. This act has taken my post-trade review from subjective to objective, and I am a major advocate of removing subjective aspects from trading. My grading rubric is pretty straightforward: pass, fail, and meh. I grade completely against my trading plan—not whether I made money or not. Meaning that if I kept to my trading plan I get a pass, and if I diverted from my plan I get a fail—but if I diverted with good reason the mark is upgraded to meh. It’s that simple.</p>
                    
                      <h2>Why Grade Against the Trading Plan?</h2>
                    
                      <p>I come from the school of thought that you need to have a predefined trading plan. You need clearly defined rules on how, when, and where you enter or exit a trade or investment. Though a trading plan can change, ideally that happens infrequently. And the plan should be backtested, not drawn from thin air—it should have basic benchmarks for returns based on past performance data.</p>
<p>In the case of the stock market, trends tend to repeat themselves as patterns. If your plan is backtested over enough time you most likely have backtested it through the current market conditions. I find it risky business to think “this time is different” and veer from my trading plan—hence a failing grade for not sticking to the plan even if I make money. And a passing grade if I stick to my plan and still lose money.</p>
<p>But sometimes changing course makes sense under the circumstances. I think most of these instances have a personal component. Maybe you have had a family emergency and need to raise money quickly. Or maybe you're on vacation and can’t get an Internet connection so you close trades early. In such cases I give my trades a score of meh. One or 2 mehs is no big deal, but if I review my grades and see a higher than usual number of mehs then I know that I need to figure out what is going on.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, grading your trades is not about performance but about fidelity to your trading plan. On paper it seems so easy: develop a plan and stick to it. But in reality that is not so easy. We are humans, full of emotions that sometimes lead us astray. Grading your trades is an effective way to monitor and measure your emotional wherewithal.</p>

                      <p>
Want day trading returns without the headache of sitting in front of 26 big-ass monitors all day? You’re in luck because today we are going to discuss trading weekly put credit spreads on the <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SPY">SPY</a>. The idea is pretty basic. I sell a put credit spread on the SPY that expires in 7 days or less. If the SPY does not drop to my short strike price I let the spread expire, keeping the credit. But before I get too detailed let’s make a detour to talk about why I started trading weekly put credit spreads—“weeklies” in hipster trader lingo—in the first place.
</p>
<p>
I like to <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/29/how-i-day-trade-the-spy">day trade the SPY</a>, but it has always bothered me that I could not backtest my strategy. I noticed that the difference between breaking even and being profitable was my personal experience and my judgement honed by keeping up with the market throughout the day. But this style of investing does not speak to me. I like probability-based trading. I like to know what my odds of success are if I put on the same trade throughout the year. And day trading the SPY does not fall into this bucket. So I started trading weeklies with the goal of returns similar to those obtained from my day trading activities. I have not given up on day trading the SPY— I am just less focused on the strategy.
</p>
<h3>How Does Trading Weeklies Differ From the Core Put Credit Spread Strategy?</h3>
<p>
My setup for weeklies is predefined. I open a credit spread on Friday or Monday and let it expire on the following Friday. I am seeking to have my short leg 2.5% away from the current SPY price with the goal of collecting 10 to 20 cents of credit for a 2-dollar-wide spread. If the SPY does not fall 2.5% within 7 days I collect the entire credit.
</p>
<p>
Clearly, this strategy has risk. Investors need to plan for occasionally getting whipped out. I combat big losses with disciplined money management—not compounding and keeping a set amount of funds in reserve. As you can see in my backtest (below) I started out with $5,000 but only traded with $4,000 and never increased my trade size. This strategy yielded a 40.78% CAGR return.
</p>

                      <h3>But Will It Work in a Bear Market?</h3>
<p>How trading weeklies will perform in a bear market is the big question. The ability to trade weekly options this way has only been around since 2011. What I do know is this: typically in a bear market volatility is higher, which means I will be able to put on trades that are further out of the money and with higher credits. I hope I can manage risk by putting on trades where the short strike is further from the current SPY price. I have been trading this strategy consistently for the past 5 months, and I plan to keep checking in from time to time to share my results.</p>

                      <p>I’m baaaaaack! But that’s not to say I am returning empty handed. . . You did notice that I took a nearly 5-month sabbatical from Stockpeer blogging—right? The catalyst was the arrival of my second child, a dangerously sweet little girl who has tipped life into the super busy zone. But a secondary reason for taking a break is that I have been exploring some new types of investment. Though I’m still experimenting, I am ready to share the low-down on what I have been playing with, starting with an overview.</p>
                    
                      <p>
    <a href="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/sab_46.png?mtime=20170514145031">
      <img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width1000/sab_46.png?mtime=20170514145031" style="width: 75%; float: none; display: block; margin: 0px auto;" alt="Sab_46" />

                      <h2>Peer-to-Peer Lending</h2>
                    
                      <p>Before I get into what Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending is, I should explain why I was looking for a new asset class. Although I mostly blog about options trading, I do invest in <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/15/the-importance-of-a-multiple-strategy-approach">multiple strategies</a> via my <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/24/scaling-your-investments-via-overflow">investment overflow plan</a>. I predict that stocks as an asset class are likely to be flat to bearish over the next 3 years—making it tough to achieve a good return via a buy-and-hold strategy—so I have been seeking other asset classes. Enter P2P lending. Companies such as <a href="https://www.lendingclub.com/">Lending Club</a> and <a href="https://www.prosper.com/">Prosper</a> have built marketplaces that match people looking for personal loans with investors willing to lend money for a return.</p>
<p>I believe the timing for this type of investment is perfect—and I am shooting for a 10 to 15% annual return with this strategy. Main street is doing great: employment is on the rise and in the foreseeable future I anticipate that the stock market will be more affected by international issues than domestic, meaning that downturns should not have a major effect on borrowers’ ability to pay back their loans. More details on P2P lending in a future post, but for now here are two great resources to check out: <a href="http://www.lendingmemo.com/">LendingMemo</a> and an episode of the <a href="http://optionalpha.com/show-024-why-peer-to-peer-lending-is-comparable-to-options-trading-17545.html">Option Alpha Podcast</a>.</p>
                    
                      <h2>Trading Weekly Put Credit Spreads</h2>
                    
                      <p>As many of you know, I like to <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/29/how-i-day-trade-the-spy">day trade the SPY</a> and have been developing a way to backtest the strategy so I can automate trading. What I have figured out is that drawing on my judgment—that is, my personal experience combined with a steady flow of information via <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/">CNBC</a>—elevates day trading to profitability. And this truth is problematic for me because I hate allowing emotion to enter into trading: I prefer using backtested systems that control when to buy and sell.</p>
<p>And so, in an effort to cut back on day trading I turned to trading weekly options on the SPY. The basic tenets are the same as those for my <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/25/baseline-strategy-for-trading-spy-put-credit-spreads">monthly put credit spread trading activities</a> but within a much narrower timeframe. I sell a put credit spread on a Friday or a Monday and I let it expire the following Friday, keeping the credit. This strategy involves risk, but it can be predictable and returns as much as my SPY day trading. Tons more on this topic soon.</p>
                    
                      <h2>Investing in Real Estate With Crowdfunding</h2>
                    
                      <p>My friend <a href="http://www.epicinvestor.com/">Eduardo Pinheiro</a> turned me on to crowdfunding real estate investments through <a href="https://www.realtyshares.com/">Realtyshares</a>. The basic concept is very similar to P2P lending: an operator raises money via equity or debt for a real estate investment and passive investors cover a portion in hopes of reaping an annual return around 15%. Realtyshares is a marketplace for connecting operators with investors. I will have much more to say on this topic in the future, but in the meantime check out Dr. Pinheiros’ blog posts:</p>

                      <h2>Is the Stock Picker Dead? Should I Spray and Pray?</h2>
                    
                      <p>In my nearly 15 years of investing a certain trend has become more pronounced each year: namely, the extra alpha your portfolio can return by your being a wise stock picker is decreasing. Stocks move as a herd. The market as a whole controls the value of stocks, and in general everything goes up on good news and down on bad news.</p>
<p>A concurrent trend is “spray and pray,” a strategy I first encountered in the venture capital world. The idea is to invest a little money in every startup out there based on the assumption that 33% will wither and die, 33% will yield small returns, and 33% will cha-ching. Spray and pray investors strip judgment, emotion, and expensive due diligence out of investment—they are simply playing probabilities, utilizing an approach similar to my credit spread trading.  </p>
<p>Given the demise of the stock picker and the rise of spray and pray, why bother doing tons of research on a company? Why spend time poring over quarterly reports? Why not manage 100 stocks rather than 15? How is spray and pray different from an index fund? Stay tuned because these are questions I am exploring.</p>
                    
                      <h2>Onward!</h2>
                    
                      <p>I wrote this post to assure you that I am still alive and so is the Stockpeer blog. And to give you a preview of the investments I plan to cover in depth in posts to come. If you have any interest in or experience with these topics, message me—I would love to chat.</p>

                      <p>
Anyone who knows me knows that I often offer unsolicited advice in the form of some statement like “You should [fill in the blank].” For example, I pretty much tell anyone I see “You should trade put credit spreads on the SPY!” The truth is, I have no business telling people what they should do—not for the obvious reason that getting up in someone’s grill is not cool, but because investing and trading are personal. What makes sense to one person might not make sense to another. Likewise, what keeps me up at night might not keep you up at night.
</p>

What I write about on <a href="http://stockpeer.com">Stockpeer</a> is my trading style. And I hope that by sharing I can inspire you to refine your own trading strategy. I am not expecting you to copy me directly; crafting your own strategy to meet your needs is key.
</p>
<p>
Traders who beat the indexes are engaged. They love what they do, and most likely they do not really care how much money they make because the trading itself excites them. Warren Buffett often says that he tap dances to work. He has found a method of trading that gets him high. I, however, would be bored to tears if I invested the way Buffett invests: I need more action, which is why I like to trade <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/25/baseline-strategy-for-trading-spy-put-credit-spreads">credit spreads</a> and <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/29/how-i-day-trade-the-spy">day trade the SPY</a>. When picking a strategy you should first consider what will make you tap dance, and then worry about how to maximize returns.

                      <p>How much money should you risk with each trade? Trade size is one of the most important considerations of an active trading strategy, and maintaining optimal trade size over time involves technique. In this post we will examine 3 methods for determining trade size and how they fared when they were backtested against my <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/5/the-only-free-lunch-in-trading-is-a-consistent-strategy">consistent</a> put <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/12/what-is-so-special-about-option-credit-spreads">credit spread</a> strategy on the SPY. In each backtest I started with a balance of $50,000 and tested from 2010 through 2014.</p>
                    
                      <h2>Trading a Fixed Amount</h2>
                    
                      <p>
One method is to risk the same number of contracts for every trade. In this case returns are not compounded. This method is popular among traders who live on trading income and therefore need to take money out of their account for expenses. For this backtest I traded a fixed lot size of 25.</p>
<div class="table-blocks">
<table><thead><tr><th>Trades</th>
			<th>Profit</th>
			<th>Return</th>
			<th>CAGR</th>									
		</tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>406</td>
			<td>$66,947</td>
			<td>133.89%</td>
			<td>18.52%</td>						
		</tr></tbody></table></div>
                    
                      <h2>Trading a Percentage of Account Balance</h2>
                    
                      <p>
Another popular method sizes each trade as a percentage of the account balance. In this backtest the maximum risk for every trade was 10% of the account balance (minus credit received). With this method returns are compounded.
</p>
<div class="table-blocks">
<table><thead><tr><th>Trades</th>
			<th>Profit</th>
			<th>Return</th>
			<th>CAGR</th>									
		</tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>385</td>
			<td>$121,368</td>
			<td>242.74%</td>
			<td>27.94%</td>						
		</tr></tbody></table></div>
                    
                      <h2>Trading a Fixed Ratio</h2>
                    
                      <p>
The fixed ratio method uses a mathematical formula to indicate when you should increase to the next lot size as your account grows. The formula is based on your largest expected drawdown—that is, how much you expect to lose when your strategy goes against you: 
</p>
<p>
<em>Current Trade Size * (½ * Largest Expected Drawdown) + Previous Account Size<em>
</em></em></p>
<p><em><em><br /></em></em><br /></p>
<p><em><em>
If, for example, you are currently trading 1 lot, your account size is $5,000, and your largest expected drawdown is $1,000—then you should start trading 2 lots when your account grows to $5,500 in value.
</em></em></p>
<p><em><em><br /></em></em><br /></p>
<p><em><em>
<em>1 * (½ * $1,000) + $5,000</em>
</em></em></p>
<p><em><em><br /></em></em><br /></p>
<div class="table-blocks"><em><em>
</em></em><em><em>Trades
			Profit
			Return
			CAGR									
		407
			$43,487
			86.97%
			13.33%						
		</em></em></div>
<p><em><em><br /></em></em><br /></p>
<p><em><em><strong>It’s a Personal Thing</strong></em></em></p>
<p><em><em><br /></em></em><br /></p>
<p><em><em>A smart trade size strategy is one way to ensure that your active trading outperforms the SPY. To wit: over the same time period as these backtests the <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SPY">SPY</a> returned (before dividends) 16.89% CAGR—3.56 percentage points more than the CAGR achieved with the fixed ratio method. Obviously there’s no point bothering with the added risk and effort of trading credit spreads if you don’t do better than just buying the SPY directly. </em></em></p>
<p><em><em><br /></em></em><br /></p>
<p><em><em>
I am not suggesting that one of the methods I backtested is better than another—the comparison is not, in fact, apples to apples. The real takeaway is how different the results can be and the importance of studying this aspect of credit spread trading. Trade size management is highly personal because each strategy carries a different risk profile. Also, when and how you need to access the money from your investments is personal. A compounding strategy might not be best for someone who needs the profits each month to pay bills. 
</em></em></p>
<p><em><em><br /></em></em><br /></p>
<p><em><em>
Managing how you use your funds to deploy your strategy is often more important than the strategy itself but it’s often overlooked by traders. Outperform the chumps by putting as much thought into your bankroll as you do your trading strategy.  
</em></em></p>
<p><em><em><br /></em></em><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>

                      <p>Many people think day trading is gambling: you might win for awhile, but eventually you will blow up your account. I agree—yet I day trade the SPY almost every day. Day trading is part of my <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/24/scaling-your-investments-via-overflow">overflow method</a> and <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/15/the-importance-of-a-multiple-strategy-approach">multiple strategy approach</a> to managing my portfolio. I day trade very little capital, and I direct the profits into my less risky accounts.</p>
<p>So why bother if day trading is gambling? Simply put, I can increase my odds of a successful return using money management techniques. I fully expect to some day lose all of the money in my day trading account—the goal is to multiply the capital I started with many times over before that happens. This strategy works because I day trade with a tiny percentage of my entire investment portfolio, and the amount I am willing to risk remains constant—meaning that I do not attempt to compound my returns; profits are removed from the account right away.</p>
<p>Already this year I have doubled the money in my day trading account (not bad considering that we are only 8 weeks into the year). And because this profit has been redirected, even if I made only losing trades from now on I would have nothing to lose because I am, so to speak,  playing with the house’s money. This is what I mean by money management: acknowledging that at any time you could blow up your account and protecting your base by resisting the temptation to compound.</p>
                    
                      <h2>Don’t Compound, Got It. But How Do You Trade?</h2>
                    
                      <p>Though day trading is gambling, you can leverage technical indicators and your own expertise to enter and exit trades with higher success rates. Here’s my formula for setting up daily trades:</p>
<ul><li><p>I only trade the SPY, which I have monitored for so long that my gut often predicts how it will move. No joke. When you’re <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/21/being-hyperfocused-on-the-spy">hyperfocused</a>, investing with your gut can be effective.</p></li><li><p>I use weekly options to add leverage and reduce the capital required. I always trade at the money call or put that’s going to expire at the end of the week. This option normally has a delta around .50, which means that if the SPY moves a $1.00 the option will increase (or decrease) in value by $0.50—a 50% return if the option you are buying costs $1.00.</p></li><li><p>I buy only calls and puts—no fancy spreads.</p></li><li><p>I try to be in a trade for 40 minutes max. Sure, sometimes a trade lasts a few hours, but I always close the trade at the end of the day no matter what.</p></li><li><p>I like to enter my trades around 1:00 pm EST when more often than not trading is flat; the news from the morning has already been traded on, and many traders are taking a lunch break. By 1:30 or 2:00 the SPY is moving and shaking again.</p></li><li><p>I enter a trade knowing whether the SPY is bullish or bearish on that day, and I never buck the trend: if the SPY is pushing up I trade calls; if the SPY is going down I trade puts.</p></li><li><p>If the market seems flat—the <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/20/how-to-use-the-rsi-indicator-to-trade-the-spy">RSI</a> and <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macd.asp">MACD</a> indicators are not hitting extremes throughout the day—I just stay out.</p></li><li><p>I make only one trade per day. If I am trading more than that most likely I am either cocky and think I can make more money or I am trying to fix a loss trade—both are bad ideas.</p></li><li><p>I never risk more than 30% of my trading account’s capital in any one trade. Yes, this percentage is high, but I am only risking money I’m willing to lose. That said, the SPY is stable so in reality the risk is more like 15%.</p></li><li><p>If the conditions are right I scale into a trade up to 4 times the dollar-cost average. I only scale down, never up—meaning I buy more as the price drops, and when I close the trade I sell everything (I do not scale out).</p></li><li><p>I time my entry by waiting for the RSI to cross 70 or 30 and then wait for the MACD lines to cross and proceed in the other direction. I also make sure the MACD histogram bars clearly resemble rolling hills, an indicator that the SPY is not flat. At this point I enter, and if the SPY continues to drop I buy more on the way down.</p></li><li><p>After entering a trade I always set a closing trade price, typically 20% higher than the option purchase price. Doing so protects me in the case of an upward spike in the market and frees me from being glued to the computer screen.</p></li><li><p>I do not set <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stop-lossorder.asp">stop losses</a>. The SPY is not crazy volatile and almost always I have some money left if a trade goes against me. Plus, I never risk more than I can handle losing. Stop losses are bad because sometimes the market really has to fall before it can pick back up. I have been down 50% only to be up 20% 10 minutes later.</p></li><li><p>I rely on my gut to time my exit (one of the reasons I have not automated this trading style). I always set out aiming for a 20% return, but if the market is not accelerating I will lower my goal until it corresponds to the reality of what the market is yielding. If a trade goes against me I simply wait for an uptick and use that opportunity to close the losing trade. Almost every day some buyer comes in and pushes the SPY up or down faster than normal in one big trade, but if not I sell at 3:59 and go all cash.</p></li></ul><p>I have set these rules for myself over many years of day trading. To get a sense of how they play out in the real world, let’s walk through a trade I made on February 23, 2015.</p>
                    
                      <p>
    <a href="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/MACD-RSI-Trading-Graph_30.jpg?mtime=20170514144729">
      <img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width1000/MACD-RSI-Trading-Graph_30.jpg?mtime=20170514144729" style="width: 100%; float: none; display: block; margin: 0px auto;" alt="Macd-Rsi-Trading-Graph_30" />
  </a>  
</p>
                    
                      <p>(*Note. The times in the graph are PST.)</p>
<ol><li><p>From the start of the day the market was bullish—notice how the chart is pushing up rather than down—so I was looking to trade calls.</p></li><li><p>At 12:35 EST the RSI crossed the 30 line—meaning the SPY was most likely going to start moving up again. I didn’t make a move yet, but turned my attention to the MACD.</p></li><li><p>About 15 minutes later the MACD lines crossed, confirming that the SPY was ready to move up. Notice that the MACD histogram bars clearly resemble rolling hills.</p></li><li><p>At 1:00 EST I entered a trade by buying SPY Feb 27 2015 210 Calls for $1.19. I benefitted from a big seller coming in right before I entered the trade, pushing the SPY down. If this event had happened later I might have scaled in and purchased more calls, but on this day one open and one closing trade did the trick.</p></li><li><p>I set a limit order to sell all the options at a price of $1.43 (a 20% gain).</p></li><li><p>At 1:30 EST I lowered my limit order to $1.37 (a 15% gain) because the market was bouncing around too much for me to be confident.</p></li><li><p>At 1:40 EST a big buyer came in and pushed the SPY up in price. My limit order hit, the trade was closed for a 15% gain.</p></li></ol><p>Most winning days play out just like this example. Though I don’t count on big buyers or sellers moving the SPY and helping me enter or exit a trade at better prices, it happens frequently and it sure is nice when it does.</p>
                    
                      <h2>Don’t Just Be a Day Trader</h2>
                    
                      <p>I just painted you a pretty rosy picture of how you can generate outsized returns day trading. The thing is, every day is different and a few bad days will certainly wipe out your account.  But if you adhere to the overflow method you can use day trading profits to juice the returns of a less risky trading strategy. Day trading is also a good way to stay engaged with the market every day and sharpen your trading skills. Such experience and knowledge make you to a better <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/12/what-is-so-special-about-option-credit-spreads">credit spread</a> trader or buy-and-hold investor. And, of course, day trading is a fun rush.</p>

Volatility has been odd lately. Mostly low but a few spikes here and there. When volatility spikes you got to jump in and place trades. Trades are taking much longer to close as well. Since volatility has been low I have not placed many trades to close in March. Lets hope that changes.</p>

      ><![CDATA[
                    
                      <p>If you're anything like me you already have a <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/5/the-only-free-lunch-in-trading-is-a-consistent-strategy">consistent</a> trading strategy figured out. You’re just placing the same trades repeatedly, trying to rack up as many occurrences throughout the year as you can. But the more you trade, the more commissions impact your performance—which is why <a href="http://www.eoption.com/">eOption.com</a> is one of my favorite brokers for trading <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/11/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">credit spreads</a>.</p>
<p>That’s because eOption.com is all about price—no frills, just trading at a very low cost. The best way to illustrate the massive savings is to compare eOption.com to other brokers (and if you haven’t already, check out <a href="https://stockpeer.com/options-broker-picker">Broker Finder</a>, the super cool tool I built for comparing brokers). Let’s say I make 100 ten lot vertical credit spread trades a year. Because I am opening and closing these trades, I rack up 200 opportunities to pay commissions. Below is a breakdown of the yearly commissions I would pay to each potential broker of these trades.</p>
                    
                      <p>
    <a href="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/broker-comare-for-options_33.jpg?mtime=20170514144425">
      <img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width1000/broker-comare-for-options_33.jpg?mtime=20170514144425" style="width: 50%; float: none; display: block; margin: 0px auto;" alt="Broker-Comare-For-Options_33" />
  </a>  
</p>
                    
                      <p>The cost difference between eOption.com and the other brokers is no joke—the closest competitor comes in $1,000 higher! What’s more, I haven’t had any execution issues and I find the no-frills approach of eOption.com to be easier and faster to navigate than that of other brokers. Plus, I have had very good customer service experiences.</p>
                    
                      <h2>So What’s the Catch?</h2>
                    
                      <p>In the case of eOption.com the catch is tools. Or more precisely, the lack thereof: eOption.com has almost no useful tools for discovering, quoting, and monitoring trades. And though eOption.com has a mobile app it isn’t very good (it appears to be software the company purchased instead of building in house). Lastly, eOption.com does not have an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">API</a> for public use (I like to write custom software to use with brokers, but not everyone rolls that way).</p>
                    
                      <p>About these shortcomings I say, “Who cares?” At one time the difference between brokers was the tools they provide, but today most tools are available free on sites such as <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Finance</a>. Meaning you can use the tools from another provider and execute your trades with eOption.com. I love the tools <a href="https://www.thinkorswim.com/">thinkorswim</a> (Ameritrade) has. I also think that <a href="https://www.tradeking.com/">TradeKing</a> has a great public API, and <a href="https://us.etrade.com/">E*Trade</a> has the best mobile app. I keep buy-and-hold or retirement accounts with all of these brokers. In addition, I often use <a href="https://www.tdameritrade.com/">Ameritrade</a> to test new trading strategies in small quantities, and I want to support what <a href="https://www.dough.com/">Dough</a> is building so I place trades with them as much as possible. But when it comes to the bulk of my yearly trading eOption.com gets my business. The point is that you can—no, should—have multiple broker accounts to leverage the best from each.</p>
<p>As the commissions graph above demonstrates, the difference in commission expenses can add some extra <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alpha.asp">alpha</a> to your yearly returns. You are in the business of making money when you trade, right? Lowering your commissions is a risk-free trade.</p>

                      <p>I treat my trading and investing as a business, and like any prudent business manager I am constantly seeking to trim costs while growing revenue. With options trading the biggest costs are the commissions your broker charges for every trade. So in the interest of taming those fees I built a tool to help you find the cheapest broker for particular options trading strategies: say hello to <a href="https://stockpeer.com/options-broker-picker">Broker Finder</a>.</p>

</p>
                    
                      <p>I routinely review and compare the broker commissions I pay, and I have realized that no one broker is the cheapest for every transaction. It comes down to the strategy you trade and how many lots per trade you place, which is why you need Broker Finder. You simply select your options strategy along with the lot size per trade and Broker Finder lists all of the popular brokers and their commissions for the trade.</p>
<p>If you are a new investor with a small account, the broker that meets your needs now most likely won’t be the best choice as your account grows. Broker Finder can help you make the switch. Or if you are a trader who puts on many trades to open (maybe you dollar cost average into your trades), a broker with a per contract commission might be better for you than one with a flat ticket charge. Options broker commissions are far more complex than typical stock purchase commissions, and Broker Finder can help you make the right choice.</p>
                    
                      <p>Broker Finder is all about finding the cheapest broker—not comparing trading tools or features. You might, for example, decide to pay more in commissions to have better tools at your disposal.</p>
<p>Do you have suggestions for making Broker Finder better? Tweet your ideas to <a href="https://twitter.com/stockpeer">@stockpeer</a> or post on the Stockpeer <a href="https://www.facebook.com/stockpeer">Facebook fan page</a>.</p>

                      <p>When I got interested in trading credit spreads, like most I harbored some <a href="https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/shows/truth-or-skepticism-with-dylan-ratigan">skepticism</a>. A credit spread trade seemed to be the type that works—until rather dramatically it does not. More than once I put on a series of successful trades and then Dr. Jeckyll transformed into his evil alter ego Mr. Hyde and suddenly I was blowing up my account. Clearly, I did not know what I was doing. On the verge of giving up, I convinced myself that I was just missing something. And so a quest was born, my friends.</p>
                    
                      <p>
    <a href="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/baseline_29.jpg?mtime=20170514144317">
      <img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width1000/baseline_29.jpg?mtime=20170514144317" style="width: 75%; float: none; display: block; margin: 0px auto;" alt="Baseline_29" />
  </a>  
</p>
                    
                      <p>c I knew that I needed to build a reliable trading strategy using past data. But even backtesting offered little hope of success until I discovered my baseline strategy.</p>
                    
                      <h2>What’s a Baseline Strategy?</h2>
                    
                      <p>What I call a baseline strategy is a set of simple restraints (or signals) that I apply to a backtest to verify that a trading strategy is profitable (and beats the S&amp;P 500). When I first devised my baseline strategy I did not think about <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/11/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">credit spreads</a> or options. Rather, I identified a trend to inform the thesis of my strategy. I focused on the <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SPY">SPY</a> (an ETF tracking the S&amp;P 500 index), a safe place to start because the price movement is pretty stable compared to individual stocks (in contrast, take a look at <a href="https://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a> after an earnings announcement). Because credit spread trades expire I examined 30- and 45-day windows, which revealed that the movement of the SPY is pretty predictable (at least downward movement; see <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/17/how-often-the-spy-falls-more-than-5-in-a-30-day-period-and-why-you-should-care">How Often the SPY Falls More Than 5% in a 30-Day Period and Why You Should Care</a>). With this information about how the SPY moves I was able to form my thesis and start backtesting.</p>
                    
                      <h2>My Baseline Strategy</h2>
                    
                      <p>
My put credit spread baseline strategy is pretty simple. I look for 2 dollars-wide SPY spreads that are at least 4% from the current stock price. I do not consider any spreads that expire more than 45 days out, and I make sure the credit received is at least $0.18. Typically you can choose from about 10 credit spreads with different expirations, strikes, and credits received. For my baseline strategy I always choose the spread with the least risk—that is, the credit spread whose short strike is furthest below the current stock price.</p>
<p>In terms of trade frequency I have two other restraints: I only make one trade per day, and I never have two spreads that share the same short strike price (though two spreads might have different expiration dates). All of these restraints were born out of trial and error and guided by a mission to keep the baseline strategy as simple as possible.
</p>
<p>
When I backtested my baseline strategy from 2005 through 2014 I got the following results:
</p>
<div class="trade-table">
<table class="table"><thead><tr><th>Number of Trades</th>
<th>Success Rate</th>
<th>Baseline % Gain</th>
<th>S&amp;P % Gain</th>
</tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>485</td>
<td>93.2%</td>
<td>82.78%</td>
<td>72.45%</td>
</tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>
Simply purchasing the SPY and holding it during the same period would have returned 72.45%. In contrast, my baseline strategy returned 82.78%. If you are thinking, “Why bother?” I urge you to remember that the strategy is only a baseline. The next step is bringing in all the fancy signals (e.g., RSI, MACD, volatility rank, delta) to optimize the strategy. The beauty of the baseline is always having something to compare against as you optimize the trading strategy.
</p>
<p>
(It’s worth noting that the weekly SPY options did not become popular until early <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/11/intro-weekly-options.asp">2011</a>, and if I backtest my baseline strategy starting in 2011 I beat the SPY by roughly 17%; this figure is approximate because I ignored dividends when comparing the SPY to the baseline strategy.)</p>
<p>A simple baseline strategy serves two very important functions: it confirms whether your strategy is effective and serves as a benchmark you can use later when optimizing your strategy with additional, more sophisticated signals. Most of the battle with a trading strategy lies in the preliminary development and subsequent optimization. A baseline is a great way to organize yourself in that critical phase to ensure that you end up deploying a SPY put credit spread trading strategy that’s more Dr. Jeckyll and less Mr. Hyde.</p>

                      <p>When I talk to people about <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/12/what-is-so-special-about-option-credit-spreads">my credit spread trading strategy</a> I often hear the claim that credit spread trading works great for 5, 10, or 20 thousand dollars, but the strategy can’t be scaled up. Are these skeptics suggesting a lack of liquidity to fill bigger orders? Or that trades in the 100 thousand range have the power to move markets? Bunkum. When trading an underlying such as the <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SPY">SPY</a> or SPX there is plenty of <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/138.asp">liquidity</a>. And you most likely need to be trading an account over 100 million before liquidity and put credit spreads are issues.</p>
                    
                      <p>
    <a href="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/water_28.jpg?mtime=20170514145241">
      <img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width1000/water_28.jpg?mtime=20170514145241" style="width: 50%; float: none; display: block; margin: 0px auto;" alt="Water_28" />
  </a>  
</p>
                    
                      <p>Maybe my friends are suggesting something else when they say my credit spread trading strategy doesn’t scale. If you are only trading a $25,000 account an annual return of 40% or more is fairly common. Returning 40% on a $200,000 account is more difficult—but not because of market mechanics. It’s more difficult because of the emotional risk involved. If something goes wrong and you lose most of your $25,000 account it’s not the end of the world. Blowing up your $200,000 account hurts a lot more, and it might take many years to recoup such a big loss.</p>
<p>Bankroll management conventional wisdom suggests that you risk less per trade as your account gets bigger—both to defend against emotional risk and to protect your nest egg. And small trades on a big account yield a lower return rate than the same number of winning big trades on a small account.</p>
                    
                      <h2>Scaling Via Overflow</h2>
                    
                      <p>I like to trade many <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/15/the-importance-of-a-multiple-strategy-approach">multiple strategies</a> so I think about scaling all of my strategies as a whole. I call this the overflow method. Imagine 3 buckets mounted above each other. The top bucket is small, the middle bucket is bigger, and the bottom bucket is the biggest. If you fill the top bucket with water it will eventually overflow and fill the bucket below it, which will likewise overflow and fill the biggest bucket on the the bottom.</p>
<p>Now, replace those buckets with your trading and investing strategies and the water with the money in your accounts. Let's assume the smallest strategy is day trading (buying and selling on a single day) and the account has $10,000. The midsize strategy might be put credit spread trading with an account of $50,000, and the granddaddy strategy is buy and hold with an account of $500,000. As the accounts grow your profits overflow to the next bigger account and less risky strategy.</p>
                    
                      <h2>Why Does the Overflow Method Scale?</h2>
                    
                      <p>In other words, with the overflow method you scale by channeling capital from your smallest, most risky accounts to your biggest, least risk-affected account. The key is making sure the account size matches the risk you put on it. Smaller accounts can take on more risk, and bigger accounts should take on less. Done right, the overflow method ensures that all of your accounts grow. Some day I hope my put credit spread account is trading many millions of dollars, but for that to happen my buy and hold (least risky) account will have to be almost 10 times that. My strategies scale based on risk.</p>

January has been an odd month. Volatility has been high with the <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=SPY">SPY</a> staying in a trading range (200 - 206 ish). Due to this market condition many of the put credit spread trades have not closed. Currently I have 6 open trades. You can follow the trades in real-time using <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/stockpeertrades?f=realtime&amp;src=hash">#StockpeerTrades</a>.
</p>
<p>
Beware this higher volatility might be a new normal. I think 2015 is going to have a fair amount of volatility. This is great for premium sellers. I am looking forward to trading this year.

                      <p><a href="http://www.macroption.com/delta-calls-puts-probability-expiring-itm/">Delta</a> is a metric that options traders use to predict how the price of an option will change when the underlying stock moves by one dollar. If, for example, a call option has a delta of .3 and the underlying stock value increases from $100 to $101, then theoretically that call option would increase in value by $0.30.</p>
<p>Delta is also a probability proxy. You can think of delta as the probability the option will expire in the money—so in other words that call option with a delta of .3 has a 30% chance of expiring in the money. The question is, should you consider the value of delta before opening a put credit spread on the <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SPY">SPY</a>? That is, before placing an order should you estimate the probability that your short leg will expire in the money, causing you to lose money?</p>
<p><strong>Backtesting (...)</strong></p>
<p>To study how delta affects an opening trade I did—of course—some backtesting. I took a $10,000 account and placed put credit spread trades from 2011 to current. I opened up spreads that were $2 wide, at least 4% out of the money, and no more than 45 days to expiration. I then ran the test only opening trades when delta was less than certain values. Below are my backtested results.</p>
<div class="trade-table">
<table class="table"><thead><tr><th> </th>
<th>No Delta Filter</th>
<th>Delta &lt;= 0.10</th>
<th>Delta &lt;= 0.15</th>
<th>Delta &lt;= 0.20</th>
<th>Delta &lt;= 0.25</th>
<th>Delta &lt;= 0.30</th>
<th>Delta &lt;= 0.35</th>
</tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Total Trades</td><td>398</td><td>3</td><td>68</td><td>377</td><td>363</td><td>363</td><td>397</td></tr><tr><td>Success Rate</td><td>94.72%</td><td>100%</td><td>100%</td><td>95.23%</td><td>94.21%</td><td>94.21%</td><td>94.71%</td></tr><tr><td>Percent Gain</td><td>210.78%</td><td>3.01%</td><td>62.64%</td><td>202.74%</td><td>168.78%</td><td>168.78%</td><td>208.96%</td></tr><tr><td>Profit</td><td>$21,078</td><td>$301</td><td>$6,264</td><td>$20,274</td><td>$16,878</td><td>$16,878</td><td>$20,895</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>As you can see, considering delta before opening SPY put credit spreads is a waste of time. I was expecting to find a perfect delta value for opening trades and was surprised to learn that you get better results by simply ignoring it.</p>
                    
                      <p><strong>Delta This, Delta That</strong></p>
<p>So why does every other options trader seem to natter on about how important delta is? For one thing, delta is more important for other underlying stocks (I will show some backtest results demonstrating as much in future posts). Delta is also very important for choosing when to exit a trade. If a trade starts to go south you can monitor the change in delta and decide whether to cut your losses or remain in the trade (more on this in future posts as well).</p>
<p>One of the reasons I especially like trading the SPY is the practicality of keeping things simple. You don’t need to crunch hundreds of inputs, such as delta, to make wise trade decisions—this study demonstrates that reassuring fact.</p>

                      <p>Almost all of my <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/12/what-is-so-special-about-option-credit-spreads">credit spread trading</a> is focused on the S&amp;P 500 via the <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q;_ylt=Am8D.cM4hnyWoRrbzGOgBWYByr0F?uhb=uhb2&amp;fr=uh3_finance_vert_gs&amp;type=2button&amp;s=spy">SPY</a> or S&amp;P 500 futures. Why am I hyperfocused on the SPY? So I can sleep at night (well, try to sleep—I do have a young son and a daughter on the way). The S&amp;P 500 is such a big index that it generally doesn’t move dramatically. In contrast, <a href="https://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ%3ANFLX&amp;ei=FWTBVNDTE6b2sQfXsIHYDw">Netflix</a> recently posted a 31% change in a single week, which is just too much for me to handle. Things really have to go haywire for the S&amp;P 500 to experience such a massive swing—something like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Flash_Crash">flash crash</a>. Though some traders make tons of money betting on volatility in individual companies, I would rather <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/5/the-only-free-lunch-in-trading-is-a-consistent-strategy">win small and win often</a>, taking as little risk as possible.</p>
                    
                      <p>
    <a href="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/focus_24.png?mtime=20170514144539">
      <img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width1000/focus_24.png?mtime=20170514144539" style="width: 75%; float: none; display: block; margin: 0px auto;" alt="Focus_24" />
  </a>  
</p>
                    
                      <p>I also know that a lot of traders consider either the technicals or the fundamentals, but I am a strong believer in studying both. If I actively trade 10 individual stocks, therefore, I need to do the homework 10 times over: 10 conference calls to pay attention to, 10 earnings reports to review. Accordingly, the money I make per hour of effort goes way down. With the S&amp;P 500 I only have to keep tabs on the market as a whole. So instead of tracking how well Home Depot beat its earnings expectations, for example, I track how many companies in the S&amp;P 500 beat theirs—and lots of services are available to do the heavy lifting for me.</p>
                    
                      <h2>Da SPY Is Superliquid</h2>
                    
                      <p>By superliquid I mean tons of people trade the SPY every day, and as a result the spread between the bid and the ask price is small. Superliquidity allows a trader to get in and out of the trade very easily, which is a very good thing—there is nothing worse than being unable to make a great trade because there isn’t anyone on the other end of it. Lots of money has been lost trading illiquid products.</p>
                    
                      <h2>Backtesting, Domain Knowledge, and Experience</h2>
                    
                      <p>A friend recently put on one of my <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StockpeerTrades?f=realtime&amp;src=hash">credit spread trades</a>. The next morning the SPY opened much lower, leading him to believe he had made a big mistake. With near certainty I reassured this friend that the trade would succeed. I don’t have a crystal ball but I do have enough experience to have a strong sense of how the SPY is going to behave. Countless hours of <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/17/how-often-the-spy-falls-more-than-5-in-a-30-day-period-and-why-you-should-care">backtesting</a> underpin my understanding of the probabilities at stake.</p>
<p>Though the trade hasn’t closed yet, at this point a profit looks likely. Having backtested results, domain knowledge, and experience can help you stay calm when times are worrisome. When you trade many different products you simply cannot maintain the confidence that a hyperfocus gives you.  </p>
<p>To be clear, I am merely highlighting the benefits of being hyperfocused on one product, not arguing against diversification. In your longer term investing portfolios you want to invest in multiple products.</p>

One that has been in my bag for awhile is buying the <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SPY">SPY</a> when the <a href="http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:relative_strength_index_rsi">Relative Strength Index (RSI)</a> indicator hits 30. My MO is to keep a tight stop and refrain from getting too greedy. Which means what, exactly? I have always based my approach to this trade on a hazy amalgam of instinct and experience, but in the name of maximizing the return I decided to systematically explore the possibilities.
</p>
<p>
So I backtested (of course) the following study. With a balance of $10,000 I purchased the SPY every time the RSI hit 30 from 1993 to the present. I then played with different closing trades, first setting the stop loss at 3% and varying the profit gain (see the top table) and then varying the stop loss and setting the profit gain at 11% (bottom table).
</p>

<td style="text-align:center;">$18,826.06</td>
</tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>
I also included in the study the <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cagr.asp">Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)</a> of the trades to allow for comparison, though most of the trades only lasted a few weeks. Using the RSI indicator to trade the SPY is not a comprehensive, long-term strategy—it’s merely an opportunity to capitalize on when certain conditions arise.
</p>
<p>
In terms of profit and loss, I got the best results when I had a stop loss of 3% and a profit gain of 11% (you can view the trades <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ccM7uYeXX4BK3P4srk2HbKCX9R0nWjTMZqoWKd2RtXo/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>). If I had been greedy and held out for 15% I would have lost a lot of money. You will also notice that—as is the case with most directional trading—my success rate was darn close to 50% for every trade. Good directional traders understand that their probability of success is always 50-50, and they make their money by knowing when to cut off a losing trade and when to close out a winning trade.
</p>
<p><strong>Some Basic Observations </strong></p>
<p>
I also tried backtesting the short side of the RSI. That is, selling short the SPY when the RSI reading crossed the upper limit of 70. Though I know this trick works in some cases, I could not make it work for the SPY and every test ended in a loss. I suspect that this approach might work best for <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/highbetaindex.asp">high beta</a> individual stocks.
</p>
                    
                      <p>
Most of you know me as an options trader, but I conducted this study for two reasons: (a) to inform one of my less public strategies (I like to trade <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/15/the-importance-of-a-multiple-strategy-approach">multiple strategies</a>) and (b) to see if I could use a naked RSI number in my <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/11/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">put credit spread</a> trading. As for the latter, I could not identify any easy ways to use the RSI number in credit spread trading strategies though I do use the general trend of the RSI to increase the odds of success—more on that in a different post. The gang over at <a href="https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/">Tastytrade</a> did a nice study on RSI and options trading and the following video is worth a watch.</p>
                    
                      <iframe width="100%" height="500" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/umWnDTNoT14" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
                    
                      <p>The RSI indicator trade is one you might make only a few times a year. Think of it as an easy way to pick up a few percentage points in your portfolio in a few weeks. You just need to watch for the right market condition and then seize the day.</p>
<p>Another one for the bag of tricks. Enjoy.</p>

                      <p>Like most traders I got started as a stock picker following the most basic of rules: do your homework and have a diversified portfolio. This credo is sound, and it’s the approach I use for <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/15/the-importance-of-a-multiple-strategy-approach">some of my accounts</a>. The key to this more traditional approach is understanding that your emotions do play a factor in your investing decisions—and that learning how to manage your emotions can be the pivot between success and failure.</p>
                    
                      <p>
    <a href="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/balls_22.png?mtime=20170514144303">
      <img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width1000/balls_22.png?mtime=20170514144303" style="width: 100%; float: none; display: block; margin: 0px auto;" alt="Balls_22" />
  </a>  
</p>
                    
                      <p>The reason I don’t often discuss trading and emotions is that even after 10 years I have not learned to truly tame my emotions. For this very reason I tend to focus on mechanical trading, which involves <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/5/the-only-free-lunch-in-trading-is-a-consistent-strategy">consistently</a> implementing a strategy that I craft using measured probabilities, shooting for high occurrences to increase my odds. It’s zero emotion, all math.</p>
                    
                      <h2>Why Do I Say Stock Picking Is Emotional?</h2>
                    
                      <p>Stock pricing (the price at which a trader is willing to buy and sell a stock) is based on similar stocks. For example, when deciding whether to invest in <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/">Home Depot</a> I would typically compare the company to <a href="http://www.lowes.com/">Lowe’s</a> and other such retailers, not <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a>. But we are all affected by brands—even a logo can influence you in ways you might not realize, and so it follows that when comparing one company to another you are likely biased.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I know: you’re comparing numbers such as <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp">P/E</a> ratios, not logos, and numbers don’t lie. Or do they? I think they can. You pick which numbers you compare, you decide how to weight each number. Though some of your decisions are informed by experience, some are based on emotions.</p>
                    
                      <p>Have you ever watched <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/15838459">Mad Money with Jim Cramer</a> or read any of his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Jim-Cramer/e/B001H6NZUS/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;qid=1421197024&amp;sr=8-2-ent&amp;tag=spicematth-20&amp;linkId=KCTFAECGZYJDGCNX">books</a>? Cramer’s father was in retail, and he tells a lot of stories about how he learned retail at a young age. He is clearly knowledgeable about the sector, but also very emotional about it. Though he exhibits the most excitement over retail, his retail stock recommendations tend to underperform his other recommendations.</p>
<p>I can’t quantify the pervasiveness of the phenomenon, but emotions can get the best of a public stock picking sage like Jim Cramer and I know they can get the best of me. It’s something we all need to be aware of when stock picking.</p>
                    
                      <h2>The Mechanical Way</h2>
                    
                      <p>Mechanical trading is a different beast. The approach removes all emotion and relies heavily on math, statistics, and probabilities. Mechanical trading pretty much flies in the face of everything <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett">Warren Buffett </a>has ever taught us about making money—it’s an altogether different way of thinking about the market.</p>
<p>Whereas a value investor says, “I believe that sometime in the future XYZ company will be worth more,” a mechanical trader proclaims, “XYZ company has a 63% chance of profit within 3 months.” The mechanical trader typically defines when to enter and exit a trade and the statistical chance of success based on clear mathematical rules, leaving all subjective feelings at the door.</p>
<p>Every trading strategy has its pros and cons, and choosing strategies that play on your strengths is important. I am an optimist. I am also greedy. And I get distracted by flashing lights. That is, I am emotional—which is why mechanical trading works best for me.</p>

                      <p><em>“If you're ignoring volatility, you may only have yourself to blame for negative surprises.” </em><em>~ John Summa - <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/university/optionvolatility">http://investopedia.com</a></em></p>
<p>The day I learned to pay attention to volatility was the day I started to be <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/5/the-only-free-lunch-in-trading-is-a-consistent-strategy">consistently profitable</a> in options trading. Most options traders start out trading stocks and they learn that if a stock is associated with good news its value often increases, whereas bad news sends a stock down. It’s that simple. The problem is that new options traders tend to think in the same terms, but options are different.</p>
                    
                      <p>
    <a href="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/vol_21.png?mtime=20170514145234">
      <img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width1000/vol_21.png?mtime=20170514145234" style="width: 100%; float: none; display: block; margin: 0px auto;" alt="Vol_21" />
  </a>  
</p>
                    
                      <p>A trader who thinks a stock is going to go up might use options to place a leveraged bet rather than buy the stock directly—which could be a mistake because an underlying stock might go up in value while the corresponding option goes down in value. What’s happening? Volatility is contracting, that’s what. That is, the premium in the option is reducing in value. As a new options trader this phenomenon is maddening. How could your <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/9/what-is-a-call-option">call option</a> go down in value when the underlying stock is going up in value?</p>
                    
                      <h2>What Is Volatility?</h2>
                    
                      <p>Simply put volatility is a measurement of how expensive it is to buy an option. Of course the conventional definition is different, but this is the best way to think about it. To dive deeper into what volatility is read <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/university/optionvolatility/">Option Volatility: Introduction by John Summa</a>.</p>
                    
                      <p>In my example where the call option is losing value while the underlying stock is increasing in value, volatility is dropping. The premium is dropping faster than the underlying stock is moving up, which causes the option price to lose value. A good example of this situation is after an earning announcement by a company. An option might have high volatility because the market is preparing for the announcement. Under such circumstances people are willing to pay a premium to be involved before an announcement they expect to be big. Once the announcement has been made investors have no reason to pay a premium to own the option. That is, volatility is high before the announcement because of uncertainty and lower after that uncertainty has been resolved.</p>
                    
                      <h2>How Do You Profit From Volatility?</h2>
                    
                      <p>Being aware of volatility is the most important factor when trading options. If you buy a call option because you think a stock is going to go up, you want volatility to be as low as possible because you will profit if volatility increases or if the stock goes up in value—meaning that two market forces have the potential to be in your favor.</p>
<p>The trades I talk most about (and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StockpeerTrades?src=hash">share on twitter</a>) are <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/12/what-is-so-special-about-option-credit-spreads">put credit spreads</a>. When you place a put credit spread the speed it takes for the trade to profit is based on volatility. If you open a trade when volatility is high and it subsequently decreases, you often carry the trade for 15 days. Conversely, if you open a trade when volatility is low you might have to carry the trade for 30 or more days. With put credit spreads volatility can be used to reduce risk in a trade because the longer a trade is on the more chances you have to lose money.</p>
<p>Volatility is the single most important measurement when trading options. Make it your bitch—or it will own you.</p>

                      <p>During any 30-day period from 1993 through 2014 the <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SPY">SPY</a> (the Exchange Traded Funds, or ETFs, tracking the S&amp;P 500) closed down 5% or more 11% of the time. I know this obscure fact because for every one of the 5,502 trading days during that period I compared the SPY closing price with the closing price 30 trading days later.

<p>And that’s not all: Further examination of 30-day periods that closed down more than 5% within shorter time frames (say 3 years) revealed rates as high as 20% during extreme bear markets (hello real estate meltdown) and as low as 3% during bull markets. That said, the 11% number was pretty consistent during most time periods.</p>

                      <h2>Why Is This Interesting?</h2>
                    
                      <p>Knowing that the SPY is more or less predictable in terms of how it performs over a random 30-day period and understanding the bear and bull market extremes form a great basis for building a <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/5/the-only-free-lunch-in-trading-is-a-consistent-strategy">consistent trading strategy</a>. How about selling <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/10/what-is-a-put-option">puts</a> 30 days to expiration 5% out of the money on the SPY?</p>
<p>I choose to study the 5% down and 30-day parameters because they match up nicely with selling put options on the SPY. You could conduct similar research using different parameters optimized for your product of choice. The important takeaway is that this type of investigation is a strong starting point for crafting an effective trading strategy.</p>
                    
                      <h2>I Am Still Losing Money —What Gives?</h2>
                    
                      <p>Let’s say you sold $2-wide SPY credit spreads 5% out of the money 30 days to expiration and collected a premium of $20 per lot. We know that 89% of the time you would keep the full premium and 11% of the time you would lose the $180 risked. By making this trade 100 times you would collect $1,780 (89 * 20) and lose $1,980 ($180 * 11)—for a total account loss of $128. Understandably, you would want to know why you are losing money on these credit spreads.</p>
<p>More to the point, you should be asking how you could build your edge to develop a successful trading strategy. Simple observations of the past often can get you close to breaking even, and fine tuning can make you profitable. So if you were able to predict when your credit spreads would fall into the 11% zone or space the timing of your trades to increase your odds, you might be able to increase your overall returns. Imagine if you were able to go from 11% of failing trades to only 5%—that is the very heart of building your edge.</p>
<p>In future blog posts I will share how I build my edge by wisely managing bankroll, integrating other metrics such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIX">VIX</a> and <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp">RSI</a> readings, and properly spacing out trades. Stay tuned!</p>

                      <p>By my best calculations, going back to my piggy bank years, my personal spending has increased by 10% annually—and my assumption is that I will continue shelling out at this rate well into the future. Sure, I am a spender, but when you really think about it 10% is not crazy. Both hidden costs such as rising property taxes and obvious money pits such as kids factor into my 10%. Though I have only been tracking my spending in recent years, I suspect that subconsciously I have been aware of my rate because I have always managed my career and investments to accommodate it. What’s your number?</p>

                      <h2>So When Can I Retire?</h2>
                    
                      <p>When planning for retirement, I have to make sure I have enough income-producing assets to provide a monthly income that grows annually by my 10% spending increase rate. Traditionally retirees give up their monthly paycheck and start living off their assets—so why am I planning to continue growing my assets in retirement? The answer, my friend, is simple: I hope to opt out of the rat race quite a bit earlier than the typical retirement age of 65 (and beyond). And with rising life expectancy rates, in spite of my stubborn refusal to eat anything green and leafy I anticipate being only about halfway down the road when I retire—which means that I cannot afford to start drawing down my retirement assets on Day One.</p>
                    
                      <h2>WTF What Is Your Point?</h2>
                    
                      <p>My point is that your retirement nest egg might need to be bigger than you think to maintain your lifestyle. I believe that tracking your spending increase each year and making projections into the future is a productive activity that will help you make career choices and investments to support your financial needs. Be warned, however, that factoring in this increase when thinking about retirement savings can be overwhelming—particularly if your rate is high like 10%—because the upshot is that you have to earn more each year while also increasing your investing and saving. Your 3% yearly raise is not going to be enough, but careful planning and smart decision making can keep you on track financially. How you live your life is up to you.</p>

                      <p>Anyone who manages their own money should use a multiple strategy approach—a form of diversification, if you will. I personally maintain 4 strategies: buying &amp; holding stocks, investing in real estate, index option credit spread trading, and directional option trading. I find these to be great options for diversification.</p>
<ul><li><p>I typically hold stocks (and some bitcoin) for 18 months or more and enjoy dividend returns. I sell a stock when the upside story changes, though I have owned some stocks for years.</p></li><li><p>My real estate investments are mostly rental properties. After enhancing the properties with remodeling I typically hold them, collecting rent, until it make sense to sell.</p></li><li><p>Each week I make multiple index option credit spread trades, mostly using the <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SPY">SPY</a> and the <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=IWM">IWM</a>. I like indexes because they require only a broad understanding of the market rather than intimate knowledge of a particular company—in other words, less risk and little effort. With each trade I aim to bring in a 10% return on capital and I shoot for a 92% (or more) win rate.</p></li><li><p>My directional option trades involve buying puts or calls depending on where I think a stock is going in the near term. I use <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/university/fundamentalanalysis/">fundamental analysis</a> to pick my stocks and <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/university/technical/">technical analysis</a> to identify entry points. For each trade I seek a profit of 30% to 50% or a stop out no lower than a 10% loss.</p></li></ul>

  </a>  
</p>
                    
                      <h2>Are You Just Bragging or Is There a Point Here?</h2>
                    
                      <p>Utilizing multiple strategies has two important benefits: you stay engaged and, typically, at all times you have at least one strategy that is performing really well. Engagement is key because when we are bored we check out. To be a good investor, however, you must always be engaged, so if you slack off when times are meh your investing and trading skills will suffer—with predictably dismal results. One failsafe of the multiple strategy approach is that when one strategy dogs it you can focus your attention and enthusiasm on the ones that are smoking.</p>
                    
                      <p>Diversification is also essential because no one strategy returns consistent (high) returns over time. Most options for diversification have good years and bad years, but by designing your overall approach will perform well in various market conditions. In the recent real estate boom, for example, you could make tons of money flipping houses. During the bust that followed you could do well collecting dividends or selling volatility via options, and in our current bull market being a buy-and-hold investor is pretty exciting.</p>
<p>I am not suggesting that you shift strategies based on the vagaries of the market because you can’t predict exactly what will happen. Rather, you should maintain multiple strategies so that as the market changes different diversification options will emerge as your best performers. Strong personal engagement and consistent portfolio returns are integral to being a good investor and multiple strategies are the means to both.</p>

<p>
Another successful month. This month was a little different from others. You will notice there were a handful of trades that took over 30 days to close and there were a handful of trades that closed pretty quickly. This shows the power of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_%28finance%29">volatility</a>. Volatility was very low in early November and then increased in December. The higher the volatility the more premium we are able to sell and the faster the options decay in value (which is what we are hoping for).
</p>
<p>
You will also notice some <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=IWM">IWM</a> (iShares Russell 2000) trades. This is new from our standard <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SPY">SPY</a> trades. I will use the IWM from time to time as well. More on trading the IWM vs. SPY in future blog posts.

                      <h2>Reviewing the Past Year</h2>
                    
                      <p>I make notes about every trade I make. In 2014 I generated more than 200 trade notes, and in the coming weeks I will be reviewing each and every one. About 80% will be tossed without another thought because they refer to standard trades that adhere to my strategy. The other 20% are more interesting—and instructive. I will dive deep into each of these trades, trying to figure out what went right and what went wrong. Each year I strive to fine-tune my trading, and keeping a trade log and reviewing it is one of the best practices a trader can have.</p>
                    
                      <h2>Preparing for the Year to Come</h2>
                    
                      <p>After reviewing the past year I start thinking about the year to come and make basic predictions about how the overall market is going to preform. As of this writing I think that in 2015 the S&amp;P 500 will be up and might close out the year up by 5% (but not much more). Our bull market is starting to lose steam and <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp">price-to-earnings ratios</a> are at their highs.</p>
<p>With some basic predictions in place I turn my consideration to bankroll management. As you know, probability-based trading requires discipline: you do not want to change your strategy often because doing so can skew your probabilities. That said, this is the time of year I reconsider my strategy and how I can tweak it to reduce risk and increase profits. How much capital do I want to risk in every trade? How much do I want to keep in cash? How much of my personal nontrading earnings do I want to add to my trading accounts?</p>
<p>If you read this far I am sure you want more details. What am I changing? What are my plans? Frankly, I don’t know yet because I am just getting started with my review, but I plan to share my findings and decisions in future posts.</p>
                    
                      <h2>What About Stockpeer?</h2>
                    
                      <p>I am really excited about the possibilities for Stockpeer.com in the coming year. Beyond blogging I hope to release several technical tools: How about an options backtester? A tool for picking the perfect brokers, anyone? Or real-time trade alerts? Lots of ideas and progress toward realizing them. Please share with me anything you want to see.</p>
                    
                      <h2>Happy Holidays!!!</h2>
                    
                      <p>All work and no play makes Johnny very boring! Please, put down your laptops at some point and enjoy life for awhile. Relax and refresh your mind, body, and soul. Thanks to everyone for the early support of Stockpeer and happy holidays! Be safe and have fun.</p>

                      <p>When considering an investment opportunity you examine 3 factors: potential return, risk of losing money, and effort required to maintain the investment. For example, when buying a stock you put a fair amount of effort into finding the best company to buy into, and you check up on the company every quarter to ensure that your strategy remains sound. Before buying, you estimate your overall return based on your assumptions, and you prudently consider how much you might lose if the trade goes against you. When comparing investment opportunities you leverage your experience to estimate values for the 3 factors—but these estimates are subjective.</p>
                    
                      <p>

                      <h2>Why Are Option Credit Spreads So Great?</h2>
                    
                      <p>In contrast, upon placing an option credit spread trade your 3 factors are pretty clearly defined. Your return is dictated by the credit you receive, and due to the very nature of an option credit spread your risk is defined by the difference between the lower strike and the higher strike minus the credit. The effort, too, is defined if you have a consistent strategy. In other words, there is almost nothing subjective about trading option credit spreads. Very few investment opportunities allow you to define all 3 factors up front.</p>
                    
                      <h2>What’s the Catch?</h2>
                    
                      <p>The catch is if your strategy is not well planned or implemented with discipline. Meaning that what makes the 3 factors so definitive when trading credit spreads is implementing a brilliant strategy with fidelity. Yes, you will lose money on some trades, but your strategy should be properly backtested so you can account for those losses.</p>
                    
                      <h2>A Word on Effort</h2>
                    
                      <p>Credit spreads are not without effort, though most of the effort is up front when you are developing your strategy. For example, I like to sell credit spreads on the <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SPY">SPY</a> because I have already spent a great deal of time perfecting when to buy and sell the spreads and how much to risk in each trade—that’s my upfront work. Now I need to devote only a few minutes a day to actually executing these trades. In one of my accounts I even have custom software I wrote to do the work for me so the effort to maintain the strategy is almost nil. This characteristic distinguishes a credit spread strategy from typical investment opportunities, which usually require more intensive ongoing effort.</p>
                    
                      <h2>The Magic of Options</h2>
                    
                      <p>The magic of options trading is that you can craft a strategy that synthetically mirrors any type of investment. I dislike relying on subjective reasoning to make investment decisions—which is why I favor option credit spreads. I can build an option strategy that has the same risk and reward of just buying stock. Or, I can build an option strategy that mimics buying rental property. Option credit spreads are just one example of an investment strategy you can craft to meet your needs.</p>

                      <p>In the options trading world there is a type of trade called a put credit spread. The goal of this trade is to collect money and hope the market does not move against you. Let me explain with an analogy we all understand: car insurance. Every month you cough up a hundred bucks or so for coverage, and your insurance company makes a calculated bet that you will not get in a car accident. If you are a safe driver, the insurance company keeps your 100 bucks. But if you drive off the road while checking stock quotes on your phone, the insurance company has to pay out to fix the damage.</p>
                    
                      <p>
    <a href="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/Safety-copy_jpg__2240×2500__13.png?mtime=20170514145046">

  </a>  
</p>
                    
                      <p>In other words, if you are a safe driver the insurance company profits—and if you are not, it takes a loss. The key is that the insurance company collects a small fee from you up front and is at risk for some length of time.</p>
                    
                      <h2>Hey—This Is a Stock Blog, not Insurance Broker Monthly!</h2>
                    
                      <p>Getting back on track... How does selling put credit spreads relate to the insurance example? Well, the idea is the same. As a trader you collect a fee that you keep if the market goes your way—but if the market goes against you, you pay out. The way it works is you sell a put option and then buy another put option to limit your risk to the spread between the puts.</p>
<p>Say the <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SPY">SPY</a> (S&amp;P 500 index ETF) is trading at $200. We could sell a put option with a strike price of $190 for a credit of $100 ($1 * 100). The put option expires in 30 days, and in the meantime we put that $100 in our account as cold, hard cash.</p>
<p>Our risk is that if the SPY drops below $190 within the next 30 days, we will have to pay out the difference below $190. That’s because by selling a put option contract we guarantee delivery of a stock at a certain price—in this case $190. And so, if in 30 days the SPY were at $185 we would lose $500 ($5 * 100), though because we collected that fee of $100 we would really lose only $400.</p>
                    
                      <p>Our hope is that the SPY stays above $190 so that the put option expires worthless and we keep the $100 collected as profit. In this case the SPY staying above $190 is like the insurance company customer not getting in a car accident.</p>
                    
                      <h2>But What Is a Put Credit Spread Really?</h2>
                    
                      <p>What I just described was the sale of a <a href="http://www.optionseducation.org/strategies_advanced_concepts/strategies/naked_put.html">naked put</a>, for which the seller assumes a massive amount of risk. For example, if the SPY were to plunge to $0 in 30 days (unlikely, but something to consider) we would be on the hook for $19,000. Obviously, we need to protect ourselves and we can do so by turning our naked put into a <a href="http://www.theoptionsguide.com/bull-put-spread.aspx">put credit spread</a> and capping our potential losses.</p>
<p>Say that we bought a put that expires in 30 days at a strike price of $188 for $65 ($.65 * 100). If the SPY were to drop below $188, our lower strike price put option would save us because we would only be at risk for $200—the difference in price between the $190 put that we sold and the $188 put that we purchased ($2 * 100).</p>
<p>Of course, we would also take a hit in terms of our credit. We collected $100 when we sold the $190 put, but we paid $65 for the $188 put so we only have $35 new dollars in our account—but we risked losing only $200 instead of $19,000. The real risk reward is $165 to make $35.</p>
                    
                      <h2>Be Your Own Little Insurance Company</h2>
                    
                      <p>As you can see, selling put credit spreads is a great way to collect a fee at regular intervals just like your car insurance company does. Because sometimes things will go against you, you protect your losses with a lower out of the money put. Put credit spreads have a much better risk and reward quotient than a naked put.</p>

                      <p>A put option is the opposite of a call option—and if you don’t know what that is, see my previous post <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/9/what-is-a-call-option">What Is a Call Option?</a> This post uses a fictional scenario to illustrate the basics of what a put option is. I do not get super detailed here, but links to more in-depth resources can be found at the end of the post.</p>
                    
                      <h2>Lets Get Started</h2>
                    
                      <p>I have a nice Apple laptop with all the bells and whistles that I paid up for in part because Apple products are known to have good resale value. I plan to retire within a year (woot!) and because I will not need the laptop anymore I hope to sell it and recoup most of my money. My target is to sell the laptop for 80% of the price I paid for it—but I am afraid that Apple might release a new line of laptops, which would accelerate my laptop’s value decline such that I could only get 50% or less. I consult with my investor friend Tim and he does not think a new line of laptops is likely in the next year. Though Tim believes I am safe, I am still not sure and wonder if there is a way to protect myself.</p>
<p>It turns out that Tim is very confident in his prediction and sees an opportunity to make some money so he offers me a deal: if I pay him a $100 fee today he will buy the laptop from me anytime in the next year for $1,600—or 80% of the $2,000 I paid. This deal (or contract) is called a put option and it gives you the right to sell something at a set price in the future in exchange for a fee.</p>
                    
                      <p>
    <a href="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/puts_12.png?mtime=20170514144955">
      <img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width1000/puts_12.png?mtime=20170514144955" style="width: 50%; float: none; display: block; margin: 0px auto;" alt="Puts_12" />
  </a>  
</p>
                    
                      <h2>The Put Option Details</h2>
                    
                      <p>Tim is betting that the value of the laptop will not drop by 20% within the next year. If the value drops by only 10% to $1,800, I will choose not to exercise my put option to sell the laptop to Tim for $1,600 because I can sell it to someone else for $1,800. I would, however, lose the $100 I paid Tim—which he would pocket as profit—and our put option would expire.</p>
                    
                      <p>But as in the case of the call option, more than one scenario is possible. If Tim is wrong and Apple does announce a new line of laptops, overnight the value of my laptop might drop by 50% to $1,000. The good news is that because I have a put option contract with Tim, he would be obligated to buy it from me for $1,600—which is $600 more than it is worth. And though I would pocket $600 more than I could have gotten if I had sold it to someone else, my total profit would be $500 ($600 less the $100 fee I paid)—that is, the gain over the market value minus what I paid for the option.</p>

                      <p>Let’s imagine that I have a tractor I am offering for sale for $20,000—which is a smoking deal because the same tractor is selling elsewhere for $25,000. My neighbor realizes that I am unaware of the fair market price and concludes that my tractor would be a good investment for him. What’s more, he has come into an inheritance—but he has to wait 6 months to get the money while the courts probate the will. Because he doesn’t want to lose this auspicious opportunity, he asks if I would sell him a call option.</p>
                    
                      <p>
    <a href="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/tractor_for_sale_jpg_11.png?mtime=20170514145227">
      <img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width1000/tractor_for_sale_jpg_11.png?mtime=20170514145227" style="width: 75%; float: none; display: block; margin: 0px auto;" alt="Tractor_For_Sale_Jpg_11" />
  </a>  
</p>
                    
                      <p>A call option is just a fancy term for a contract related to selling an asset in the future. My neighbor offers me $1,000 to take the tractor off the market and store it until he is ready to buy it in 6 months. This $1,000 does not apply to the cost of the tractor—he still has to pay me $20,000 at the time of the sale. If he does not keep his end of the bargain I can keep the $1,000 and sell the tractor to someone else.</p>
                    
                      <h2>Call Options Carry Risk</h2>
                    
                      <p>After selling the call option I might discover that my tractor is really worth $25,000. Worse, perhaps demand goes up and 6 months from now my tractor is worth $30,000. Because I sold my neighbor the call option I am contractually obligated to hold onto the tractor and sell it to him for $20,000—and he could turn around and sell the tractor to someone else for $9,000 profit.</p>
<p>But that scenario is not the only possible outcome. The tractor could lose value over those 6 months. Maybe a serious defect is discovered in this model and as a result the tractor’s market value drops to $15,000. My neighbor might decide not to buy the tractor from me either because he can buy it from someone else for $15,000 rather than the $20,000 he agreed to pay me—or because he prefers a tractor that is not prone to blowing up. In either case I keep the $1,000 and the tractor but lose the $5,000 extra I would have made if I had sold the tractor outright 6 months earlier even though it was underpriced at $20,000.</p>
<p>Call options can be used with any asset—tractors, stocks, real estate. The key is that both parties assume the potential for risk and reward. If the price of the underlying asset moves up or down while the call option is in effect one side will lose money. The buyer of the call option can tie up an asset by spending only a fraction of the asset’s value to do so.</p>

                      <p>The difference between success, failure, and mediocrity on Wall Street is your ability to pick a smart trading or investing strategy and stick to it. Jumping into the market without first carefully defining your strategy is akin to driving a car with a blindfold on—and, likewise, you will crash at some point. Just as critical is remaining faithful to your strategy during drawdowns—because you will reap the benefits of constancy in the long run.</p>

                      <h2>How to Pick a Smart Trading Strategy</h2>
                    
                      <p>I use a 3-step process: brainstorm, backtest, analyze. The objective of the brainstorming step is to identify big-picture concepts to backtest such as these:</p>
<ul><li>Over a 45-day period what was the maximum up or down movement of the S&amp;P 500 over the last 12 years?</li><li>During the last 10 years what was the typical stock move the day after Home Depot’s earnings report?</li><li>What are the most actively traded stock options by year for the last 10 years?</li><li>Does a spike in the put/call ratio for the SPY have any predicating ability for its future movement?</li></ul><p>If I am stuck for ideas I might surf <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/">seekingalpha.com</a>, <a href="http://stocktwits.com/">stocktwits.com</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/">twitter.com</a>.</p>
<p>Once I have a diverse list of 10 or so questions I start backtesting. Typically I do some sampling in Excel and then use a backtesting tool such as <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/">Quantopian</a> or write my own software scripts. Brokers typically offer tools as well.</p>
                    
                      <p>Through analysis of the big-picture backtesting results I narrow my list to a few concepts worth digging into further to more precisely define my trading strategy. For example, I might find out that over a 45-day period the S&amp;P 500 dropped more than 5% only 3% of the time. Those odds are good—so maybe my strategy would be to sell put options 5% out of the money expiring in 45 days.</p>
<p>I then backtest my refined strategy and analyze those results in terms of probability of success (wins vs. losses), total risk per trade, estimated return on capital, and difficulty to execute (i.e., Do I need to be glued to my computer all day?).</p>
                    
                      <h2>Implementing Your Strategy</h2>
                    
                      <p>After you have settled on a trading strategy compatible with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and skills it’s time to roll—virtually, at least. Typically I suggest paper trading for a while, less to see if your strategy works than to practice executing trades and managing your emotions. Trust me—it’s an important, time-honored step toward getting your head in the game.</p>
<p>When you’re ready to commit hard, cold capital I suggest starting with a small account, typically $2,000. If you can demonstrate success in different market conditions with a small account, your odds of success with a larger account are good. At this point you should step back and let your strategy do its thing. Monitor performance but refrain from adjusting your strategy too often—backtesting is your proof that your trading strategy works.</p>

Wall Street is the domain of traders and investors. Typically we envision traders sitting in front of rows of monitors looking to make a quick buck by continually getting into and out of financial positions. In contrast, investors are the Warren Buffett types who buy and hold stocks for long periods of time. Traditionally, you are one or the other because traders and investors often disagree, maintaining that the strategy of the other is a recipe for underperformance. Despite their differences, I use the terms trader and investor interchangeably because all incumbent strategies include a trading component (making money on short-duration trades) and an investment component (buying and holding).

      <img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width1000/Tortoise-and-the-Hare_jpg_9.png?mtime=20170514145224" style="width: 75%; float: none; display: block; margin: 0px auto;" alt="Tortoise-And-The-Hare_Jpg_9" />
  </a>  
</p>
                    
                      <p><strong>Should I Trade or Invest?</strong></p>
<p>
Whether to trade or invest comes down to the opportunities offered and your bias. The stock market exhibits different themes over time (e.g., bull, bear, flat, fearful, bubble). Currently we appear to have been in a bull market since March 2009, and in a bull market buy and hold is a great strategy: stocks are appreciating while dividends increase. The problem is that you never know when a bull market will end—and when it does, whether it will flatten out or pull back aggressively. By the time you know the answer you might have given up a fair amount of gains. Although your positions might be profitable, your year-over-year total returns might suffer.
</p>
<p>
So how do you protect against ending bull markets? Trading. Trades are opportunities to make a few bucks quickly. A trade might be driven by an event such as an earnings announcement or based on the probability of selling credit spreads or any other strategy you might come up with. A trade is nothing more than leveraging the market’s movements—or lack thereof—to increase the gains of your overall core portfolio. And when a bull market ends your trading proceeds can offset gains lost as the market settles.
</p>
                    
                      <p><strong>Pick Your Bias</strong></p>
<p>
Trading to defend your core invested portfolio assumes that you are fundamentally biased toward being an investor. You can flip that approach if you are biased toward being a trader. That is, your core money-making activity could be short-duration trades in the market that you pair with an invested backstop to help maintain margin requirements while growing your portfolio over time.
</p>
<p>
Every day the market presents opportunities for trading and opportunities for investing. Not taking advantage of both is a form of not being diversified, which puts at risk your overall yearly returns.

<p>
Another successful month. Mostly closing out trades made during the high volatility we saw in <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/4/why-i-am-sharing-my-trades-october-2014-trades">October</a>. The trades that we put on in November (which will be reported in December) are taking much longer to close out because volatility has dropped. This month our trades took an average of 15.66 days to close. Our trades next month will take longer because of the low volatility. We made an average profit of 10.03% on our trades this month. Pretty good. 
</p>
                    
                      <p>
You will notice a trade with a wider spread than normal this month (SPY Put Spread 180 / 176 Nov 22 2014). This was not a wise trade. We took more risk for almost the same return as our normal 2 dollar wide spreads. It took longer to close this trade as well.  
</p>
<p>
In the second half of November volatility was low and the <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp">RSI</a> reading as been high we did not place many trades. We need the market to pull back a bit before placing more trades. We might not make many trades in the coming weeks. Only time will tell.

What I mean by a consistent trading strategy is if you build a smart trading strategy and stick to it you are almost certain to make money. I make this claim with such conviction because I assume that you <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/backtesting.asp">backtest</a> your strategy. That you factor in maximum drawdown periods (times when you lose money). And most critical, that you understand the importance of fidelity to your strategy—because inconsistent strategy is the road to a blown-out account.
</p>
                    
                      <p>

  </a>  
</p>
                    
                      <p><strong>Build a Smart Consistent Trading Strategy</strong></p>
<p>
Go as far back as possible and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtesting">backtest</a> the heck out of your strategy to verify that it works. Acknowledged: past performance is not an indicator of future returns—but it is all you have to base your strategy on so I say stick with it. And remember to factor in drawdown periods. Don’t kid yourself—even the best consistent trading strategy will periodically break down and you will lose money. A good backtest will give you an idea of how much you are likely to lose during big drawdowns, but be conservative and assume that the future might hold even bigger drawdowns. Also, make sure you are managing your cash so you can trade through drawdown periods. 
</p>
                    
                      <p><strong>Don’t Waver (Often)</strong></p>
<p>
Every strategy needs to be monitored and adjusted—but resist the temptation to constantly tweak. If your strategy is not ready for prime time you should be <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/papertrade.asp">paper trading</a> or trading with a very small amount of money. The biggest mistake is making too many adjustments. Keep calm and carry on trading through drawdown periods. Do not panic.  </p>
<p><strong>Enjoy Your Free Lunch</strong></p>
<p>
If you backtest you will have confidence in your strategy, and if you are disciplined your strategy should succeed. With strategy-based trading the hard work is up front. Do not overthink things or get emotional about returns when you are finally implementing your consistent trading strategy. Consistency is the only free lunch.

Below you will find all of the trades I closed out in October 2014. I plan to post a summary of my complete (not cherry picked) credit spread portfolio each month, and in the future I will share trades as I make them. Why am I doing this? Because bragging about my winning trades strokes my ego, of course. :)
</p>
<p>
Though that last statement might be partly true, I am really divulging my trades for more worthy reasons. For one, I want to share my successes and failures so others can see what I do every day—and hopefully we can start a conversation. You see, trading is a solo sport that results in a lot of second guessing of oneself. When I review the trades of others I feel less lonely and, more important, I learn. Which leads me to the second reason: through dialog with other traders I hope to become a better trader myself. Also, I enjoy helping new traders by explaining the rationale for my trades. Lastly, I am seeking a kind of validation by sharing my trades—particularly my successes. After all, this is a trading and investing blog and on Wall Street you live and die by your trades. I invite you to use my trading performance to help you decide whether you want to bookmark and share on social media my blog posts.

As you can see, October was a great month of trading. Credit spread traders yearn for months like this. The <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=%5EVIX">VIX</a> spiked on fears related to the Ebola crisis, tensions between Russia and Ukraine, and suspicion that the market correction we have all been expecting was imminent. When volatility (VIX)  spikes we can collect bigger amounts of premium when selling credit spreads.
</p>
                    
                      <p>
It remains to be seen whether or not we are going to retest the lows we hit in October. I think the market will continue to rise or will flatten out. October marked the start of the last quarter of the year, and I believe that when the S&amp;P 500 hit its low fund managers started to buy. A spike often occurs in the last quarter because fund managers want to close out the year on a high note—that is, with profits.
</p>
<p>
Corporate earnings have been great in 2014, Ebola seems to be under control (the media coverage was overblown), and the situation in Russia is not likely to have a major impact here at home. When the S&amp;P was falling I was selling put credit spreads all the way down—typically out 30 to 45 days—with the knowledge that the market would pick back up or at least not drop too far. Corrections <a href="http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000321243">typically pull back 10%</a> from their highs so I was watching the 180 level on the <a href="https://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSEARCA%3ASPY&amp;ei=Vp9SVMCRD9CziALp3ID4Dg">SPY</a>, figuring that any put spreads I could sell below that would have a high chance of returns.
</p>
<p>
When the fear sell-off was done the VIX came back, causing the put spread to have nice gains. Most of the trades I closed in October 2014 closed a week or two earlier than normal due to the swing in volatility.

Welcome to the inaugural blog post of <a href="http://stockpeer.com">Stockpeer.com</a>. To find out more about me, <a href="https://twitter.com/spicermatthews">Spicer</a>, take a detour and check out the <a href="http://stockpeer.com/about">About page</a>. To learn more about Stockpeer, read on.
</p>
<p>
I have been investing and trading in the stock market for more than a decade and developing web and mobile software for <a href="https://cloudmanic.com/">Cloudmanic Labs</a> since I founded the company in 1998. When a person has been doing something for 10 years I usually assume that he or she has reached expert status. I am not convinced, however, that anyone can be considered an expert in the wild and wooly worlds of investing and software development—so let’s just say I have learned a thing or two. I envision Stockpeer as a forum for sharing my experience and knowledge to help others create wealth and a place to document trading research and innovations. Though I intend to baby step Stockpeer initially, I have plans for much, much more—eventually.</p>
                    
                      <p>
    <a href="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/newspaper-418919_1280_6_161007_220925.jpg?mtime=20170514144829">
      <img src="https://cdn.options.cafe/blog/_width1000/newspaper-418919_1280_6_161007_220925.jpg?mtime=20170514144829" style="width: 50%; float: none; display: block; margin: 0px auto;" alt="Newspaper-418919_1280_6_161007_220925" />
  </a>  
</p>
                    
                      <p>For now the focus of Stockpeer will be how I use custom software in my daily trading. I plan to share the results of different algorithms I have developed to gain an edge in the market, trade more efficiently, and learn how the market really works. I do not expect to talk much about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-frequency_trading">high frequency trading</a> (HFT) because it’s not really my thing. (I make this disclaimer because people often associate HFT with algorithms and computer-assisted trading.)</p>
                    
                      <p>What I am most interested in is using software to process massive amounts of data to inform trading decisions. I tend to favor options trading; at least, I have the most to say on that topic. I might also touch upon bankroll management, real estate, and long-term equity investing.</p>
<p>Over time Stockpeer will expand, but initially I am broadcasting to the world whatever opinions and insights I have to offer via regular blog posts. Please bookmark this blog, add it to your RSS reader, and of course follow Stockpeer on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/stockpeer">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/stockpeer">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://plus.google.com/b/102290166024113046526/102290166024113046526"></a><a href="https://google.com/+Stockpeer">Google+</a>.</p>
