<p>Options traders in December were laughing like this kid all the way to the bank! Well maybe not really. No retirement plans just yet.

This month is a good example of why you never second guess your strategy. You will notice I put on 2 spreads a day apart with nearly the same strikes prices and the same expiration.</p>
