<p>If you are an <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/making-volatility-your-bitch">options volatility trader</a> November was a boring month. I opened 2 <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">put credit spread trades</a><a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread"></a> in November -- none closed. We will look at these closing trades in December.</p>
<p>We are in sit and wait mode. Just like this dog......</p>
