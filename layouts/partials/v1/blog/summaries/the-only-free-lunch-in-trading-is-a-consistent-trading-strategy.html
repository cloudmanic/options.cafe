<p>What I mean by a consistent trading strategy is if you build a smart trading strategy and stick to it you are almost certain to make money. I make this claim with such conviction because I assume that you <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/backtesting.asp">backtest</a> your strategy. That you factor in maximum drawdown periods (times when you lose money). And most critical, that you understand the importance of fidelity to your strategyâ€”because inconsistent strategy is the road to a blown-out account.</p>
