<p>Anyone who manages their own money should use a multiple strategy approachâ€”a form of diversification, if you will. I personally maintain 4 strategies: buying &amp; holding stocks, investing in real estate, index option credit spread trading, and directional option trading. I find these to be great options for diversification.</p>
