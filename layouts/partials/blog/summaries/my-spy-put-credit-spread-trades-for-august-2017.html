<p>If your a follower of this blog or a follower of my trades you might have noticed I stopped posting trades. That is all about to change starting with this post. I am once again committed to posting the trades I place monthly. The reason for the absence in trade posting is we have been crazy busy preparing for the launch of our new <a href="https://options.cafe/">trading platform</a> -- Just not enough hours in the day :(.</p>
