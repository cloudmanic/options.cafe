<p>During any 30-day period from 1993 through 2014 the <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SPY">SPY</a> (the Exchange Traded Funds, or ETFs, tracking the S&amp;P 500) closed down 5% or more 11% of the time. I know this obscure fact because for every one of the 5,502 trading days during that period I compared the SPY closing price with the closing price 30 trading days later.</p>
