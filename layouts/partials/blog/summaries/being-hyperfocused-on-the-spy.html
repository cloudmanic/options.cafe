<p>Almost all of my <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/12/what-is-so-special-about-option-credit-spreads">credit spread trading</a> is focused on the S&amp;P 500 via the <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q;_ylt=Am8D.cM4hnyWoRrbzGOgBWYByr0F?uhb=uhb2&amp;fr=uh3_finance_vert_gs&amp;type=2button&amp;s=spy">SPY</a> or S&amp;P 500 futures. Why am I hyperfocused on the SPY? So I can sleep at night (well, try to sleepâ€”I do have a young son and a daughter on the way). </p>
