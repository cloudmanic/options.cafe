<p>When I talk to people about <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/12/what-is-so-special-about-option-credit-spreads">my credit spread trading strategy</a> I often hear the claim that credit spread trading works great for 5, 10, or 20 thousand dollars, but the strategy canâ€™t be scaled up. Are these skeptics suggesting a lack of liquidity to fill bigger orders?</p>
