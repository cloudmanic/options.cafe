<p>As you can see from my trades in the table below May 2018 was a winning month. This is a great example of good times with this strategy. With my <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">Put Credit Spread Trades</a> strategy we have good months, bad months, and "meh" months. It was a nice surprise to have this good month after a <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/my-spy-put-credit-spread-trades-for-april-2018">losing month</a>. Helps get back our losses.</p>

                      <p>Let's hope for another great month next month! </p>
<p>On a side note I am looking forward to summer very much. As I watch the flowers blossom after a long winter I feel renewed. I like to take the summer time to reflect on the last 6 months and prepare for the coming months. </p>
