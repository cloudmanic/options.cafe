<p>Say hello to Options Cafe! As the Founder and CEO of Stockpeer, and a tenured software developer, I am excited to announce that the Stockpeer.com blog is retiring and <a href="https://options.cafe">Options.Cafe</a> is taking over. When I registered <a href="https://stockpeer.com/">Stockpeer.com</a> nearly 10 years ago, I had a much different vision. While I was trading options, at the time, stocks were my passion. Fast forward to today, and options have become the bulk of my trading activity.<br /></p>
                    
                      <h2>New Name New Vision</h2>
                    
                      <p>When I registered <a href="https://stockpeer.com">Stockpeer.com</a> nearly 10 years ago, I had a much different vision. While I was trading options, at the time, stocks were my passion. Fast forward to today, and options have become the bulk of my trading activity. With the fluctuating state of the global marketplace, this is the route many self-investors are taking.</p>
<p>Why? Because when leveraged properly, options have <em>higher </em>returns, <em>less</em> risk, and are <em>far more</em> predictable. A far more strategic method of investing your hard-earned money!</p>
                    
                      <h2>More Than Just A New Name</h2>
                    
                      <p>Our new name doesn’t just reflect our passion for options, but something far more exciting! For the last several months the Options Cafe Team has been tucked away working on something special. We have been building innovative new options trading software. Lots of it. </p>
<p>It’s not just software, but an entire trading platform dedicated solely to options. This is the same options trading software I’ve been using for my personal trading for the last 5 years — rebuilt to serve the masses.</p>

                      <h2>Graduating From Blog To Software Company</h2>
                    
                      <p>What most trading software brokers provide is too generic. The software tries to be all things to all people. As you well may know, this approach doesn’t work.</p>
                    
                      <p>Options Cafe decided to take an entirely different approach: <em>to excel in one area of trading—options only</em>. Built to accommodate advanced multi-leg trades (think put credit spreads, or iron condors) our software stands out from the crowd. Options Cafe primary area of focus will be:<br /></p>
<ul><li><p>An easy and efficient way to display the status of your options. We combine your multi-leg options into <em>one </em>trade strategy, making it easier to manage and monitor. </p></li></ul><ul><li><p>A robust screener. Stop spending hours searching for quality trades. Input your strategies and goals into our options trading software, and options that fit your criteria will populate.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Finally, custom reporting just for options traders. Ever wonder how long your credit spreads take to close on average? Option Cafe can tell you. Do you find tracking account performance to be tough when you're constantly depositing new money into your account or taking cash out to live? We’ve got you covered. </p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Don’t trade blind. Assess how well your current and previous strategies have performed, and build entirely new strategies with our options backtesting tool. Test run your strategy day-by-day as if you were there placing the trades. You can even view how would your strategy have performed over a designated time frame—going back 10 years or more.</p></li></ul><p>Options Cafe will not be a broker; we communicate with brokers on your behalf. Our soft launch is targeted for fall of 2017, with the launch of <a href="https://brokerage.tradier.com/?utm_campaign=options.cafe">Tradier</a> (one of our favorite brokers for options trading). We aim to add additional brokers shortly thereafter.  </p>
<p>We hope you are excited as we are for our transition from trading blog to options trading software. I can’t wait to share Options Cafe with everyone.</p>
<p>Keep Trading,</p>
<p>~Spicer</p>
