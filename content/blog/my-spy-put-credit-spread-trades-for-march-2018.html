<p>Here we explore the put credit spread trades I placed on the SPY durning the month of March 2018. This is my primary trading strategy for <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/related-topics/monthly-income">monthly income</a>. By trading put credit spreads on the <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/related-topics/spy">SPY</a> I am typically in a trade for 23 days but no more than 45 days.</p>
