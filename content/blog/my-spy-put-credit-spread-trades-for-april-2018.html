<p>As you can see from my trades in the table below April 2018 was a losing month. This is a great example of when things go bad -- and they always do. Honestly, this was not even a bad month compared to other bad months. Based on an average net credit of $0.23 it will take 5 winning SPY <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">Put Credit Spread Trades</a> to get back the losses from this month.</p>

                      <p>My rule of thumb is to always close trades at the end of day if the current SPY stock price is below the short strike of my SPY Put Credit Spread. </p>
<p>While it might be painful it is much better to lose a small amount of money than lose 100% of the money. One of my trades got completely away from me (the 100% loss) -- while one of my trades was only a 30% loss as I was able to close it before it got too far past the short strike of my Put Credit Spread.</p>
<p>This month was an opportunity to remember to be humble in this trading strategy. As a reminder it is important to always be prepared for down months.<br /></p>
