<p>With September 2018 over we look forward to autumn. This was a little bit of a boring month as we only closed one trade. We do have some trades on the board that will close in October. <br /></p>

                      <p>This is how <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">put credit spreads</a> go. Some months are very exciting -- some are just meh. Personally, I really enjoy autumn. There is something special about the change of seasons. I will sit on cash while I watch the foliage change. When the market changes I am ready to trade. </p>
