<p>July has come and gone. We partied for America's birthday and closed a few profitable trades! Darn good month! July 2018 was another winning month for my SPY <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">Put Credit Spread</a> trading strategy. </p>
<p>However, only closing 3 trades for the month is a bit of a sign. Makes me think the market is stalling and might change direction. Low volatility is never a comfortable place to be in. I am starting to prepare for a pull back.</p>
