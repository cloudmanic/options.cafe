<p>Well, finally an engaging month for <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">Put Credit Spreads</a>. Afraid the engagement was in the wrong direction. In November we took some losses. Not a big deal since we have had so many winning past months. However, losses are never fun.</p>

                      <p>This month was a good month for learning to deal with losses. As you can see from my trades some of my positions took big percent losses. Since I trade rather small this does not matter much. Yes, it erases many months of gains but this is how the strategy goes. We call this a drawdown period. </p>
