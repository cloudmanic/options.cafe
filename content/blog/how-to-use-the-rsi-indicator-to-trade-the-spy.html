Every great trader has a bag of tricks. Each of these opportunities, if you will, is a predefined market condition signaling when to enter a trade and when to close it. One that has been in my bag for awhile is buying the <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SPY">SPY</a> when the <a href="http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:relative_strength_index_rsi">Relative Strength Index (RSI)</a> indicator hits 30. My MO is to keep a tight stop and refrain from getting too greedy. Which means what, exactly? I have always based my approach to this trade on a hazy amalgam of instinct and experience, but in the name of maximizing the return I decided to systematically explore the possibilities.
</p>
<p>
So I backtested (of course) the following study. With a balance of $10,000 I purchased the SPY every time the RSI hit 30 from 1993 to the present. I then played with different closing trades, first setting the stop loss at 3% and varying the profit gain (see the top table) and then varying the stop loss and setting the profit gain at 11% (bottom table).

<p>
I also included in the study the <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cagr.asp">Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)</a> of the trades to allow for comparison, though most of the trades only lasted a few weeks. Using the RSI indicator to trade the SPY is not a comprehensive, long-term strategy—it’s merely an opportunity to capitalize on when certain conditions arise.
</p>
<p>
In terms of profit and loss, I got the best results when I had a stop loss of 3% and a profit gain of 11% (you can view the trades <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ccM7uYeXX4BK3P4srk2HbKCX9R0nWjTMZqoWKd2RtXo/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>). If I had been greedy and held out for 15% I would have lost a lot of money. You will also notice that—as is the case with most directional trading—my success rate was darn close to 50% for every trade. Good directional traders understand that their probability of success is always 50-50, and they make their money by knowing when to cut off a losing trade and when to close out a winning trade.
</p>
<p><strong>Some Basic Observations </strong></p>
<p>
I also tried backtesting the short side of the RSI. That is, selling short the SPY when the RSI reading crossed the upper limit of 70. Though I know this trick works in some cases, I could not make it work for the SPY and every test ended in a loss. I suspect that this approach might work best for <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/highbetaindex.asp">high beta</a> individual stocks.

                      <p>
Most of you know me as an options trader, but I conducted this study for two reasons: (a) to inform one of my less public strategies (I like to trade <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/15/the-importance-of-a-multiple-strategy-approach">multiple strategies</a>) and (b) to see if I could use a naked RSI number in my <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/11/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">put credit spread</a> trading. As for the latter, I could not identify any easy ways to use the RSI number in credit spread trading strategies though I do use the general trend of the RSI to increase the odds of success—more on that in a different post. The gang over at <a href="https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/">Tastytrade</a> did a nice study on RSI and options trading and the following video is worth a watch.</p>

                      <p>The RSI indicator trade is one you might make only a few times a year. Think of it as an easy way to pick up a few percentage points in your portfolio in a few weeks. You just need to watch for the right market condition and then seize the day.</p>
<p>Another one for the bag of tricks. Enjoy.</p>
