<p>June 2018 was another winning month for my SPY <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">Put Credit Spread</a> trading strategy. Since IVR has been pretty low closing this many trades was a darn good thing. Just have to be careful to not trade too big. Overall this was a low number of trades for a month -- hence one might want to start increasing trade size. I would not suggest that. A down draw is always just round the corner. </p>

                      <p>As we head into summer we should look at market pasts. The summer is often a random time. We have had big drawdowns, or flat "meh" markets. I always take trades when I have them but try to be aware of the over all direction of the market. Sometimes I reduce trade size in the summer if I am unsure. </p>
<p>Do not forget to enjoy the summer time.....but keep an eye on the market as well. </p>
