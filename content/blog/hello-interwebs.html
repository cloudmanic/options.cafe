Welcome to the inaugural blog post of <a href="http://stockpeer.com">Stockpeer.com</a>. To find out more about me, <a href="https://twitter.com/spicermatthews">Spicer</a>, take a detour and check out the <a href="http://stockpeer.com/about">About page</a>. To learn more about Stockpeer, read on.
</p>
<p>
I have been investing and trading in the stock market for more than a decade and developing web and mobile software for <a href="https://cloudmanic.com/">Cloudmanic Labs</a> since I founded the company in 1998. When a person has been doing something for 10 years I usually assume that he or she has reached expert status. I am not convinced, however, that anyone can be considered an expert in the wild and wooly worlds of investing and software development—so let’s just say I have learned a thing or two. I envision Stockpeer as a forum for sharing my experience and knowledge to help others create wealth and a place to document trading research and innovations. Though I intend to baby step Stockpeer initially, I have plans for much, much more—eventually.</p>

                      <p>For now the focus of Stockpeer will be how I use custom software in my daily trading. I plan to share the results of different algorithms I have developed to gain an edge in the market, trade more efficiently, and learn how the market really works. I do not expect to talk much about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-frequency_trading">high frequency trading</a> (HFT) because it’s not really my thing. (I make this disclaimer because people often associate HFT with algorithms and computer-assisted trading.)</p>
                    
                      <p>What I am most interested in is using software to process massive amounts of data to inform trading decisions. I tend to favor options trading; at least, I have the most to say on that topic. I might also touch upon bankroll management, real estate, and long-term equity investing.</p>
<p>Over time Stockpeer will expand, but initially I am broadcasting to the world whatever opinions and insights I have to offer via regular blog posts.
