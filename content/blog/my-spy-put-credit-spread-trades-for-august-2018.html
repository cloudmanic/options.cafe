<p>With August 2018 in the bag we look forward to September. Traders leave their Hamptons pads and get back to work. My SPY <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">Put Credit Spread</a> trading strategy only closed one trade this month. Hoping for a creep up in IVR next month.<br /></p>
