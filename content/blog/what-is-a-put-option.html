<p>A put option is the opposite of a call option—and if you don’t know what that is, see my previous post <a href="https://stockpeer.com/blog/9/what-is-a-call-option">What Is a Call Option?</a> This post uses a fictional scenario to illustrate the basics of what a put option is. I do not get super detailed here, but links to more in-depth resources can be found at the end of the post.</p>
                    
                      <h2>Lets Get Started</h2>
                    
                      <p>I have a nice Apple laptop with all the bells and whistles that I paid up for in part because Apple products are known to have good resale value. I plan to retire within a year (woot!) and because I will not need the laptop anymore I hope to sell it and recoup most of my money. My target is to sell the laptop for 80% of the price I paid for it—but I am afraid that Apple might release a new line of laptops, which would accelerate my laptop’s value decline such that I could only get 50% or less. I consult with my investor friend Tim and he does not think a new line of laptops is likely in the next year. Though Tim believes I am safe, I am still not sure and wonder if there is a way to protect myself.</p>
<p>It turns out that Tim is very confident in his prediction and sees an opportunity to make some money so he offers me a deal: if I pay him a $100 fee today he will buy the laptop from me anytime in the next year for $1,600—or 80% of the $2,000 I paid. This deal (or contract) is called a put option and it gives you the right to sell something at a set price in the future in exchange for a fee.</p>

                      <h2>The Put Option Details</h2>
                    
                      <p>Tim is betting that the value of the laptop will not drop by 20% within the next year. If the value drops by only 10% to $1,800, I will choose not to exercise my put option to sell the laptop to Tim for $1,600 because I can sell it to someone else for $1,800. I would, however, lose the $100 I paid Tim—which he would pocket as profit—and our put option would expire.</p>
                    
                      <p>But as in the case of the call option, more than one scenario is possible. If Tim is wrong and Apple does announce a new line of laptops, overnight the value of my laptop might drop by 50% to $1,000. The good news is that because I have a put option contract with Tim, he would be obligated to buy it from me for $1,600—which is $600 more than it is worth. And though I would pocket $600 more than I could have gotten if I had sold it to someone else, my total profit would be $500 ($600 less the $100 fee I paid)—that is, the gain over the market value minus what I paid for the option.</p>

                      <p>Put options are mostly used in the stock market against a stock (rather than a laptop), but they can be used in any type of transaction. The following links are good resources for learning more about put options:</p>
