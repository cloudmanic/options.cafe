<p>March had some good trades!! A very winning month. The best part about the month, for me at least, is Oregon had some epic snow. I had some amazing turns in! I digress.....back to options.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">Put Credit Spreads</a> strategy is looking good! If April is a good month we should be back to even from our <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/my-spy-put-credit-spread-trades-for-january-2019">January</a> drawdown.</p>
