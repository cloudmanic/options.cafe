<p>More losses this month for our <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">Put Credit Spreads</a> strategy. Mainly a losing trade that was put on in 2018 and crossed over. I <strong>think</strong> the markets are calming down and we will start to draw back up. We did have one winning trade which felt good. Take the little wins :). </p>

                      <p>One thing to note. The trade above that had a closing debit of $0.00 and 100% loss I let expire. I just could not find a good exit point. <br /></p>
