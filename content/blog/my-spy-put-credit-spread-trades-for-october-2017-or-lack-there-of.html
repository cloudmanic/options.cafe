<p>If your an <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/making-volatility-your-bitch">options volatility trader</a> this is how you felt in the month of October. I was unable to open any <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">put credit spread trades</a><a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread"></a> in October. Bottomline......volatility was super low! I think the market is just sort of flat waiting for tax reform. </p>
<p>Good news is I have already opened 2 put credit spread trades in November. Hopefully we will return to normal here soon.</p>

<p>Keep in mind this is normal. Many volatility based options traders with a <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/the-only-free-lunch-in-trading-is-a-consistent-trading-strategy">consistent strategy</a> often have dry months.</p>
