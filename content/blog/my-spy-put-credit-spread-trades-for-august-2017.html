<p>If your a follower of this blog or a follower of my trades you might have noticed I stopped posting trades. That is all about to change starting with this post. I am once again committed to posting the trades I place monthly. The reason for the absence in trade posting is we have been crazy busy preparing for the launch of our new <a href="https://options.cafe/">trading platform</a> -- Just not enough hours in the day :(. As we are getting close to the launch of the platform I have more time for posting trades. </p>
<p>As you can see only one SPY put credit spread closed in August. The markets have been very very very flat this year. So getting trade opportunities has been very hard. Hopefully as we head into the fall this will change. </p>

                      <h2>Why do I post my trades every month?</h2>
<p>I am a big fan of trading options as a form of monthly income. I think <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/how-option-greeks-affect-the-premium-you-trade">selling premium</a> in options over and over again far out performs any other investing / trading strategy that I know of. Yes, we all can make big wins day trading but it never lasts. Almost everyone blows out their account at some point. When placing probability based options trades you know how successful you should be month after month. </p>
<p>With that said -- the reason I share my trades is to spread the success of these types of strategies. My goal is to convince people looking to become day traders to move away from those ideas and embrace these ideas. </p>
<p>There are lots of strategies for selling options premium for monthly income. My strategy is outlined <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/baseline-strategy-for-trading-spy-put-credit-spreads">here</a>.  </p>
