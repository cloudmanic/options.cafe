<p>Thanks to the Trump tax cuts the market in January 2018 was pretty stable. Just creeping up in value each day. With volatility so low there were not many opportunities for SPY <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">Put Credit Spread Trades</a>. While I opened a few trades none closed. At the end of January the tax party came to an end and the market got cray cray. Lots to report in my February 2018 update. </p>
