<p>Have you ever wondered how your options trading strategy would perform over time? I have, so I built a <a href="https://stockpeer.com/backtest">backtester</a>. I wanted a way to simulate trading the options market day to day to see how well my strategies would have fared. Until now I have kept this backtester to myself, but today I am happy to introduce the Stockpeer backtester to the world. You can play with it by visiting <a href="https://stockpeer.com/backtest">https://stockpeer.com/backtest</a>.</p>
<p>Full disclosure: the backtester is far from complete. Consider this a super early alpha launch. I am offering only the ability to backtest the SPY, using put credit spreads, on end-of-day data. Want to see more options? More features? Share the love. Let me and others know you think the Stockpeer backtester is a cool tool by <a href="https://twitter.com/stockpeer">tweeting</a> about it or sharing it on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/stockpeer">Facebook</a>. Why? Because a good backtester is cumbersome and expensive to build, but your support and feedback will motivate me to continue making progress.</p>
                    
                      <h2>Backtester Goals</h2>
                    
                      <p>Although backtesting an investment strategy is not a new concept, the options world seems to lack good backtesting tools. My goal was to build something simple yet robust. Something that does not require the user to be a computer programmer. A backtester that allows you to test different strategies quickly just by pointing and clicking.</p>

                      <p>Most important, I aspire to build something that helps others learn and contributes to the conversation about options trading. Real data with real results eliminates subjective thinking and promotes objective thinking.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://stockpeer.com/backtest">Stockpeer backtester</a> is still in development, but I believe there is value in sharing earlier rather than later. I invite you to play with the backtester, share your results with others, and pass along any feedback you might have. Enjoy!</p>
