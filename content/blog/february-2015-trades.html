<p>Here we explore the put credit spread trades I placed on the SPY durning the month of February 2015. This is my primary trading strategy for monthly income. By trading put credit spreads on the SPY I am typically in a trade for 23 days but no more than 45 days.<br /></p><table class="table"><thead><tr><th>Ticker</th><th>Type</th><th>Spread</th><th>Expire Date</th><th>Open Date</th><th>Closed Date</th><th>Open Credit</th><th>Closed Debit</th><th>Profit / Loss</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>SPY</td><td>Put</td><td>185 / 187</td><td>2/20/15</td><td>1/6/15</td><td>2/3/15</td><td>$0.19</td><td>$0.03</td><td>8.84%</td></tr><tr><td>SPY</td><td>Put</td><td>184 / 186</td><td>2/20/15</td><td>1/5/15</td><td>2/3/15</td><td>$0.22</td><td>$0.03</td><td>10.67%</td></tr><tr><td>IWM</td><td>Put</td><td>106 / 108</td><td>2/20/15</td><td>1/11/15</td><td>2/4/15</td><td>$0.22</td><td>$0.03</td><td>10.67%</td></tr><tr><td>SPY</td><td>Put</td><td>189.5 / 191.5</td><td>2/20/15</td><td>1/26/15</td><td>2/9/15</td><td>$0.17</td><td>$0.03</td><td>7.65%</td></tr><tr><td>SPY</td><td>Put</td><td>189 / 191</td><td>2/20/15</td><td>1/8/15</td><td>2/9/15</td><td>$0.19</td><td>$0.03</td><td>8.84%</td></tr><tr><td>SPY</td><td>Put</td><td>190 / 192</td><td>2/27/15</td><td>1/27/15</td><td>2/11/15</td><td>$0.19</td><td>$0.03</td><td>8.84%</td></tr><tr><td>IWM</td><td>Put</td><td>106.5 / 108.5</td><td>3/6/15</td><td>1/29/15</td><td>2/16/15</td><td>$0.24</td><td>$0.03</td><td>11.93%</td></tr><tr><td>IWM</td><td>Put</td><td>103 / 105</td><td>2/27/15</td><td>1/13/15</td><td>2/19/15</td><td>$0.21</td><td>$0.03</td><td>10.06%</td></tr></tbody></table><p>
Volatility has been odd lately. Mostly low but a few spikes here and there. When volatility spikes you got to jump in and place trades. Trades are taking much longer to close as well. Since volatility has been low I have not placed many trades to close in March. Lets hope that changes.</p>
