<p>Options traders in December were laughing like this kid all the way to the bank! Well maybe not really. No retirement plans just yet. After a bit of a dry spell I closed 2 <a href="https://options.cafe/blog/what-is-a-put-credit-spread">put credit spread trades</a> (see table below).</p>

                      <p>This month is a good example of why you never second guess your strategy. You will notice I put on 2 spreads a day apart with nearly the same strikes prices and the same expiration. Some might see this as too much risk. My strategy is based on the fact that around 11% of my trades will loss money. I never know which 11% so I just place trades if there are trades to be had. Never second guess. Build a strategy, backtest it, monitor it, and only make lasting changes to your strategy (no one off, second guessing, changes). </p>
