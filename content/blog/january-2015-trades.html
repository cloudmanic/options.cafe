	Here we explore the put credit spread trades I placed on the SPY durning the month of January 2015. This is my primary trading strategy for monthly income. By trading put credit spreads on the SPY I am typically in a trade for 23 days but no more than 45 days.<br /><br /><table class="table"><thead><tr><th>Ticker</th>

January has been an odd month. Volatility has been high with the <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=SPY">SPY</a> staying in a trading range (200 - 206 ish). Due to this market condition many of the put credit spread trades have not closed. Currently I have 6 open trades. You can follow the trades in real-time using <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/stockpeertrades?f=realtime&amp;src=hash">#StockpeerTrades</a>.

Beware this higher volatility might be a new normal. I think 2015 is going to have a fair amount of volatility. This is great for premium sellers. I am looking forward to trading this year.
