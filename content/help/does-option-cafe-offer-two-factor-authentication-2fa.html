  Yes. 2FA is an extra layer of security used to make sure that people trying to
  gain access to an online account are who they say they are. First, a user will
  enter their username and a password. Then, instead of immediately gaining
  access, they will be required to provide another piece of information.

  We highly recommend setting up two-factor authentication (2FA) with your
  Options Cafe account.

  If you want to secure your Options Cafe account with 2FA, youâ€™ll need to log
  into Options Cafe using a Google Sign-In. You can use Google Sign-In with 2FA
  through their own authentication app,
