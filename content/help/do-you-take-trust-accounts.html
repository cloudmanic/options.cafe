<p>
  Tradier&nbsp;does support trust accounts, but they need to be set up
  manually.&nbsp; Trust accounts are considered professional accounts according
  to the NYSE and other market centers that provide real-time quotes.&nbsp; The
  estimated cost for this is $100/month.<br /><br />Please contact Tradier
  customer support directly to set up your account. You can email them
  at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:service@tradierbrokerage.com" target="_blank"
    >service@tradierbrokerage.com</a
  >&nbsp;and mention you want to set up a trust account that will be linked to
  Options Cafe.
