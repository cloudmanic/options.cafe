information we collect through log files to create a profile of our users. Log files record internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser types, internet service providers
(ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp and number of clicks (Aggregate Information) to analyze trends, administer the Site, track a customers
movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Aggregate Information is not linked to personally identifiable information. A
profile is stored information detailing how individual customers use the site. It is used solely for internal purposes, to help us improve the experience of our
customers. We do not share your profile with any third parties.<br><br>5. Cookies. We use cookies to recognize and count new visitors and to acquire aggregate
information that lets us analyze traffic patterns and tune the performance and functionality of the Site. A cookie is a file that is placed on your hard drive when you
